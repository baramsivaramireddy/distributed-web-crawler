For WikiProjects, any page in the project (\"Wikipedia:\") namespace is accepted. Categories are based on those of the Wikipedia article, if the Wikipedia article already exists. If it does not, you can specify them within the request. There is currently no way to automatically migrate these category and WikiProject memberships into articles directly.\n\nExample request to expand an existing article\nExample request to create a new article\nSandbox!\nSearching[edit]\nThrough the Search interface.\nBy transcluding the {{Wikipedia Requests}} template \u2013 see the instructions on that page.\nCurrently you can only get lists based on very simple criteria. The ability to do set comparisons will come later.\n\nAdding[edit]\nAdd one request, recommended for those who have not used this before\nBulk import interface, not recommended for first-timers\nTransition project[edit]\nThe value of Wikipedia Requests comes from centralizing the scattered to-do lists of Wikipedia. If you would like to transition a given to-do list to this new system, just add it below.\n\nWikipedia:WikiProject Women scientists/Worklist \u2013 in progress\nUser:Piotrus/List of Poles - note that some entries have incorrect red links, for example improper capitalization or are missing diacritics. If this is a major issue, ping me and I'll see if it can be fixed. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:56, 20 April 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nThere is a ton of lists categorized under Category:Wikipedia requested articles and its subcategories... standardizing those this should keep us busy for a long while. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:56, 20 April 2016 (UTC)[reply]\nI recently had an idea about how to find missing lists of topics, see here. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here 07:59, 20 April 2016 (UTC)[reply]\n\n\n\n\nRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Requests&oldid=1179081891\"\nCategory: Wikipedia requests\n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last edited on 7 October 2023, at 19:21\u00a0(UTC).\nText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License;\nadditional terms may apply.
