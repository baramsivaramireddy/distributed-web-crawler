It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages, or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories.\nThis is a tracking category. It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme.\n\nThis category is hidden on its member pages\u2014unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance \u2192 Show hidden categories) is set.\nThese categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing \"attention en masse\" (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience.\nThese categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list (discriminated by classifications).\nThis category is for articles, media files and other content that does not yet exist or about which there may be an issue requested to be resolved. It is also for requested actions related to articles, such as peer review and improvement requests. See Wikipedia:Request directory for more request departments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSubcategories\nThis category has the following 20 subcategories, out of 20 total.\nA\n  Requests for A-Class review (9 C)\n Archive requests (empty)\n  Wikipedia requested articles (6 C, 200 P)\n  Wikipedia requested audio (3 C, 495 P)C\n Wikipedia articles with content forks (7 P)E\n Wikipedia conflict of interest edit requests (213 P)H\n Candidates for history merging (empty)\n Candidates for history splitting (1 F)I\n  Wikipedia requested images (9 C, 9,241 P)\n  Wikipedia articles with an infobox request (506 C, 525 P)M\n  Wikipedia articles with missing information (19 C)\n  Requested moves (2 C, 352 P)N\n  Wikipedia requests in non-existent categories (3 C)P\n  Current peer reviews (11 C, 79 P)\n  Requests for peer review (7 C, 97 P)S\n  Wikipedia articles with sections named inappropriately (4 C)\n Spoken Wikipedia requests (1,018 P)T\n Talk pages requiring geodata verification (empty)\n  Wikipedia articles needing translation (2 C, 20 P)V\n Wikipedia requested videos (367 P)\n\nPages in category \"Wikipedia requests related to articles\"\nThe following 2 pages are in this category, out of  2 total.
