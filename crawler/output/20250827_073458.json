This includes appeals to delete pages kept after a prior discussion.\nIf you are considering a request for a deletion review, please read the \"Purpose\" section below to make sure that is what you wish to do. Then, follow the instructions below.\n\n\nPurpose\n\nShortcutWP:DRVPURPOSEWP:DRVPURPOSE\nDeletion review may be used:\n\nif someone believes the closer of a deletion discussion interpreted the consensus incorrectly;\nif a speedy deletion was done outside of the criteria or is otherwise disputed;\nif significant new information has come to light since a deletion that would justify recreating the deleted page;\nif a page has been wrongly deleted with no way to tell what exactly was deleted; or\nif there were substantial procedural errors in the deletion discussion or speedy deletion.\nDeletion review should not be used:\n\nbecause of a disagreement with the deletion discussion's outcome that does not involve the closer's judgment (a page may be renominated after a reasonable timeframe);\n(This point formerly required first consulting the deleting admin if possible. As per this discussion an editor is not required to consult the closer  of a deletion discussion (or the deleting admin for a speedy deletion) before starting a deletion review. However doing so is good practice, and can often save time and effort for all concerned. Notifying the closer is required.)\nto point out other pages that have or have not been deleted (as each page is different and stands or falls on its own merits);\nto challenge an article's deletion via the proposed deletion process, or to have the history of a deleted page restored behind a new, improved version of the page, called a history-only undeletion (please go to Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion for these);\nto repeat arguments already made in the deletion discussion;\nto argue technicalities (such as a deletion discussion being closed ten minutes early);\nto request that previously deleted content be used on other pages (please go to Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion for these requests);\nto attack other editors, cast aspersions, or make accusations of bias (such requests may be speedily closed);\nfor uncontroversial undeletions, such as undeleting a very old article where substantial new sources have subsequently arisen. Use Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion instead. (If any editor objects to the undeletion, then it is considered controversial and this forum may be used.)\nto ask for permission to write a new version of a page which was deleted, unless it has been protected against creation. In general you don't need anyone's permission to recreate a deleted page, and if your new version does not qualify for deletion then it will not be deleted.\nCopyright violating, libelous, or otherwise prohibited content will not be restored.\n\n\nInstructions\nShortcutWP:DELREVDWP:DELREVD\nBefore listing a review request, please:\n\nConsider attempting to discuss the matter with the closer as this could resolve the matter more quickly. There could have been a mistake, miscommunication, or misunderstanding, and a full review may not be needed. Such discussion also gives the closer the opportunity to clarify the reasoning behind a decision.\nCheck that it is not on the list of perennial requests. Repeated requests every time some new, tiny snippet appears on the web have a tendency to be counter-productive. It is almost always best to play the waiting game unless you can decisively overcome the issues identified at deletion.\nSteps to list a new deletion review\nIf your request is completely non-controversial (e.g., restoring an article deleted with a PROD, restoring an image deleted for lack of adequate licensing information, asking that the history be emailed to you, etc), please use Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion instead.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n1.\n\n\nClick here and paste the template skeleton at the top of the discussions (but not at the top of the page). Then fill in page with the name of the page, xfd_page with the name of the deletion discussion page (leave blank for speedy deletions), and reason with the reason why the discussion result should be changed. For media files, article is the name of the article where the file was used, and it shouldn't be used for any other page. For example:\n\n{{subst:drv2\n|page=File:Foo.png\n|xfd_page=Wikipedia:Files for deletion/2009 February 19#Foo.png\n|article=Foo\n|reason=\n}} ~~~~\n\n\n\n2.\n\n\nInform the editor who closed the deletion discussion by adding the following on their user talk page:\n\n{{subst:DRV notice|PAGE_NAME}} ~~~~\n\n\n3.\n\n\nFor nominations to overturn and delete a page previously kept, attach <noinclude>{{Delrev|date=2025 August 27}}</noinclude> to the top of the page under review to inform current editors about the discussion.\n\n\n\n4.\n\n\nLeave notice of the deletion review outside of and above the original deletion discussion:\n\nIf the deletion discussion's subpage name is the same as the deletion review's section header, use <noinclude>{{Delrevxfd|date=2025 August 27}}</noinclude>\nIf the deletion discussion's subpage name is different from the deletion review's section header, then use <noinclude>{{Delrevxfd|date=2025 August 27|page=SECTION HEADER AT THE DELETION REVIEW LOG}}</noinclude>\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nCommenting in a deletion review\nAny editor may express their opinion about an article or file being considered for deletion review.  In the deletion review discussion, please type one of the following opinions preceded by an asterisk (*) and surrounded by three apostrophes (''') on either side.  If you have additional thoughts to share, you may type this after the opinion.  Place four tildes (~~~~) at the end of your entry, which should be placed below the entries of any previous editors:\n\nEndorse the original closing decision; or\nRelist on the relevant deletion forum (usually Articles for deletion); or\nList, if the page was speedy deleted outside of the established criteria and you believe it needs a full discussion at the appropriate forum to decide if it should be deleted; or\nOverturn the original decision and optionally an (action) per the Guide to deletion. For a keep decision, the default action associated with overturning is delete and vice versa. If an editor desires some action other than the default, they should make this clear; or\nAllow recreation of the page if new information is presented and deemed sufficient to permit recreation.\nExamples of opinions for an article that had been deleted:\n\n*'''Endorse''' The original closing decision looks like it was sound, no reason shown here to overturn it. ~~~~\n*'''Relist''' A new discussion at AfD should bring a more thorough discussion, given the new information shown here. ~~~~\n*'''Allow recreation''' The new information provided looks like it justifies recreation of the article from scratch if there is anyone willing to do the work. ~~~~\n*'''List''' Article was speedied without discussion, criteria given did not match the problem, full discussion at AfD looks warranted.  ~~~~\n*'''Overturn and merge''' The article is a content fork, should have been merged into existing article on this topic rather than deleted. ~~~~\n*'''Overturn and userfy''' Needs more development in userspace before being published again, but the subject meets our notability criteria. ~~~~\n*'''Overturn''' Original deletion decision was not consistent with current policies. ~~~~\nRemember that deletion review is not an opportunity to (re-)express your opinion on the content in question. It is an opportunity to correct errors in process (in the absence of significant new information), and thus the action specified should be the editor's feeling of the correct interpretation of the debate. Deletion review is facilitated by succinct discussions of policies and guidelines; long or repeated arguments are not generally helpful. Rather, editors should set out the key policies and guidelines supporting their preferred outcome.\nThe presentation of new information about the content should be prefaced by Relist, rather than Overturn and (action). This information can then be more fully evaluated in its proper deletion discussion forum. Allow recreation is an alternative in such cases.\n\nTemporary undeletion\nAdmins participating in deletion reviews are routinely requested to restore deleted pages under review and replace the content with the {{TempUndelete}} template, leaving the history for review by everyone. However, copyright violations and violations of the policy on biographies of living persons should not be restored.\n\nClosing reviews\nA nominated page should remain on deletion review for at least seven days, unless the nomination was a proposed deletion. After seven days, an administrator will determine whether a consensus exists. If that consensus is to undelete, the admin should follow the instructions at Wikipedia:Deletion review/Administrator instructions. If the consensus was to relist, the page should be relisted at the appropriate forum. If the consensus was that the deletion was endorsed, the discussion should be closed with the consensus documented. \nIf the administrator closes the deletion review as no consensus, the outcome should generally be the same as if the decision was endorsed. However:\n\nIf the decision under appeal was a speedy deletion, the page(s) in question should be restored, as it indicates the deletion was not uncontroversial. The closer, or any editor, may then proceed to nominate the page at the appropriate deletion discussion forum, if they so choose.\nIf the decision under appeal was an XfD close, the closer may, at their discretion, relist the page(s) at the relevant XfD.\nIdeally all closes should be made by an administrator to ensure that what is effectively the final appeal is applied consistently and fairly but in cases where the outcome is patently obvious or where a discussion has not been closed in good time it is permissible for a non-admin (ideally a DRV regular) to close discussions. Non-consensus closes should be avoided by non-admins unless they are absolutely unavoidable and the closer is sufficiently experienced at DRV to make that call. (Hint: if you are not sure that you have enough DRV experience then you don't.)\n\nSpeedy closes\nObjections to a proposed deletion can be processed immediately as though they were a request at Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion\nWhere the closer of a deletion discussion realizes their close was wrong, and nobody has endorsed, the closer may speedily close as overturn.  They should fully reverse their close, restoring any deleted pages if appropriate.\nWhere the nominator of a DRV wishes to withdraw their nomination, and nobody else has recommended any outcome other than endorse, the nominator may speedily close as \"endorse\" (or ask someone else to do so on their behalf).\nCertain discussions may be closed without result if there is no prospect of success (e.g. disruptive or sockpuppet nominations, if the nominator is repeatedly nominating the same page, or the page is listed at WP:DEEPER).  These will usually be marked as \"administrative close\".\nActive discussions\n27 August 2025\n26 August 2025\nSemi-metro\nSemi-metro (talk|edit|history|logs|links|watch) (XfD|restore)\nHello everyone, I'm aware that the majority of votes indicated to merge. However, in my opinion the AfD-discussion focused on the term, rather than on the subject/topic of the article. The subject/topic (being \"partial grade separated light rail\") meets WP:GNG and I think this warrants a separate article.\u2014\u00a0Preceding unsigned comment added by KatVanHuis (talk \u2022 contribs) 13:02, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nEndorse The original closing decision was sound. Discussion of the term was relevant. If the subject of the page is simply \u201cpartial grade-separated light rail\u201d it can be covered within the light rail article. There is no compelling reason presented here to overturn the original closing decision. -- RickyCourtney (talk) 14:10, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nProcedural close as a blatant abuse of process. The appellant bludgeoned the AfD with 18 comments, all saying basically the same thing, and is now here for yet another free bite at the apple. Merge was the clear consensus in this widely participated AfD, and even the appellant admits so. The only basis for this appeal can be summed up in the words of Captain Tenneal: \"Well, you're all wrong!\". I don't think we should waste another hour on this, let alone seven days. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 14:15, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse:\nThis appears to be a case where one editor in an AFD mistook length of argument with strength of argument and so thinks that they should have prevailed in the AFD by filibustering.\nThis appears to be a case where the appellant is saying that the closer was wrong because the closer did not supervote.\nThe instruction to drop the stick is overused, so my reference to it is preterition.  Robert McClenon (talk) 17:17, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nSelf endorse, KatVanHuis checked in with me before opening this, and I saw no other way to close the discussion so I was happy for them to bring it here for more POVs. Star Mississippi 23:46, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse. Editors are authorized to decide not to retain an article about a topic that meets GNG (a scenario discussed at length in Wikipedia:Notability, the same guideline that includes WP:GNG). There was a consensus to merge.\u2014Alalch E. 00:41, 27 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n25 August 2025\nLilyfield light rail station\nLilyfield light rail station (talk|edit|history|logs|links|watch) (XfD|restore)\nThere are a number of issues with the closure, which also apply in the case of the simultaneously-deleted Juniors Kingsford light rail station page. I will preface all of this by apologising for unwittingly violating the WP:CANVASSING policy. The editors whom I pinged ought not to be disregarded for this unbeknownst policy breach of mine. Those whom I pinged and who responded were right to be alerted to the topic, having contributed extensively to this and related subjects, and should have their arguments taken seriously, because those arguments are sensible. My actions here constitute a significant flaw in the discussions and the ability of the closing editor to make a sound judgement, but they are not the only error in the proceedings.\nMy arguments will refer to both articles since the issues are essentially the same. Hence, if possible, I would like for this application to be considered to concern both.\nConsensus has been misinterpreted, in that it does not exist. OwenX rightly corrected me in noting that AfD discussions are not a mere headcount. But, the editors who advocated for maintaining these articles \u2013 which for nearly two decades have cycled between creation and erasure \u2013 made valid points in regard to both policy and widely-established practice in terms of covering transportation infrastructure. The opposing argument based on the GNG treated it as gospel rather than guidance, and particularly fails to account for the realities of covering public transportation infrastructure \u2013 even when notable. Per the policy, a topic can meet the criteria but not be notable, or vice-versa. One may refer to the articles for stations of London's Tramlink, the G:Link, the Canberra Metro and Manchester Metrolink to grasp this, as well as New South Wales articles such as that for Macdonaldtown railway station (which has referencing to a similar quality as the latter stage light rail articles) or nearby Ashfield (inferior). I accept if the latter portion of this paragraph is beside the point for the purposes of this review, and advances an argument which belongs only in an AfD discussion. I do not know, so I have chosen to make this point.\nIn any case, it is worth noting that the discussion for Lilyfield was tied, whilst the Juniors Kingsford discussion was 5\u20134 in favour of redirecting (not counting the initiator). It is unclear what may have been the result with more time, or with wider engagement.\nAs stated, discussions on this matter have been unending. Previous discussions have usually found in favour of retaining light rail station articles in Sydney, the most recent occurring this year. Such discussions took place in March 2006, December 2006 (twice concurrently), and from January to March this year. These discussions indicated general support for retaining or re-establishing station articles. Articles for all then-operational light rail stations were available until 2013, when they were summarily erased as part of a broader reorganisation. As I understand it, articles are not supposed to be endlessly re-litigated.\nThe discussions, in the unusual way they were held, have led to the bizarre situation of two articles being redirected whilst others exactly of their kind remain. These cover Wentworth Park light rail station, Circular Quay light rail station, Randwick light rail station and the Central light rail platforms. These are, likewise, healthy articles. Another editor suggested that the practice of these two discussions being held concurrently violated WP:MASSAFD and WP:RUSHDELETE. The length of the discussion periods may also have been insufficient, even though one was extended, given the history of these articles being created and erased \u2013 a history which will not end here.\nThe articles were significantly expanded, in the case of Lilyfield by myself and in the case of Juniors Kingsford by myself and one other editor, after the recent discussions began. This directly implicates the arguments supporting erasure made in regard to length, notability, the availability of sources (though there are broader limitations concerning public transportation infrastructure) and duplication. It is arguable that, if the station articles could aptly be merged into the line articles beforehand, then this is no longer ideal. Further, the coverage of other stations has the potential be expanded in a similar way, which would lead to significant bloat should everything continue to be centralised in one document. This centralisation discourages the improvement of coverage.\nIn 2006, arguments in favour of retaining station articles were partially predicated on the notion that, over time, the articles might grow. Indeed, this has borne true, with the length and quality substantially improving over time (see the Lilyfield article in 2012 compared to recently; Juniors Kingsford station did not yet exist). These articles will later exist in further improved form, regardless of the recent erasure. They will be reinstated as reliable coverage continues to grow, just as they have been previously. (The sourcing on the Lilyfield article was actually better than on the line article, as I recently rectified errors which still exist in the line article.)\nDue to the failures in the discussions wrought by myself and the initiator, consensus is not determinable. There may have been flaws in the arguments advanced by myself and others for retaining the articles, but these are balanced by the oversights of those who advanced erasure. The articles should be reinstated, pending yet another discussion if that is deemed necessary, continuing the endless back-and-forth. Will Thorpe (talk) 08:54, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nNo action because of WP:TLDR. In view of the limited resource that is our volunteer time, DRV requests should not be, as in this case, longer than the article at issue.  Sandstein  11:28, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n@Sandstein I acknowledge that it is long, but that seems a little unfair. There are multiple issues at play here which I have sought to outline. The fates of these articles (plural!) do matter, even if they are relatively small. I, too, sacrificed some time of my own to outline these issues when I am busy with a number of professional and scholarly commitments. I did this for the benefit of those such as you.\nI have seen that on many days, there are no deletion review requests at all. I can italicise or bold the key points, if that helps. Will Thorpe (talk) 11:36, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nIf one divides the length of my response by the number of times that this discussion has occurred, and given the fact that it concerns two articles in the same position, then perhaps the length is a little more understandable. Cheers, Will Thorpe (talk) 11:51, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse.  Good close.  Lots of weak !votes were appropriately downweighted.  There was a consensus to redirect with the third !vote, and nothing added after changed it.  Some source analysis could have trumped, but there was none.  On my analysis, the first three references do not meet the WP:GNG.  I think there is no commentary on the station, the article was just a collection of rolling facts. Articles need secondary source content.  \u2014SmokeyJoe (talk) 12:50, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nReview the article reference lists and you will find that the majority of information is attributed to secondary sources.\n@SmokeyJoe, in which article are you referring to the first three sources? If it is Lilyfield, then NSWrail is a resource used on just about every rail-related article for New South Wales. So is Transport for NSW, a government agency.\nPer Wikipedia:WikiProject Australian Transport/Sources, Transport for NSW is held to be reliable; NSWrail has not been adjudicated on. Now look at the reference list for Summer Hill railway station, which is referenced about as well as most railway stations in New South Wales; dare I say in most of the world. Ashfield railway station, Sydney is larger, yet is more reliant on these sources. The truth, which complicates matters, is that articles concerning public transport have always struggled with WP:GNG, even when they are clearly notable. This is why it is important to remember that GNG is a guideline. Will Thorpe (talk) 13:08, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nInterestingly, these larger stations also have substantially smaller article bodies. I do not know what the difference is that could make them notable and these not. Would you have an answer? Will Thorpe (talk) 13:12, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNotable means that others have written about it.  \u201cWriting about\u201d does not include compilations of facts. I\u2019m looking for subjective adjectives. I am talking about the difference between primary source material and secondary source material, using definitions from the field of historiography.\nThe three sources I looked at are:\n1. https://transportnsw.info/routes/details/sydney-light-rail-network/l1/780l1\n2. https://glebesociety.org.au/socialhistory/rail-transport-in-glebe/\n3. http://www.nswrail.net/lines/show.php?name=NSW:wardell_road_central\nSmokeyJoe (talk) 13:55, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n@SmokeyJoe, in that case, I have addressed two of the sources you refer to directly \u2013 and they are probably used on every public railway station article in New South Wales, and for others related. All up, that will account for close to five hundred articles \u2013 stations and other railway infrastructure. Likely more. For many of those articles, the proportionate reliance on those sources is greater than in the articles herein discussed, yet there is still no question of notability.\nIf you please, look at the reference list on Ashfield railway station, and from there look at as many other railway stations within NSW as you can. What makes the reliance on these sources disqualifying here despite them being essential everywhere else? Ashfield fails the test, and so does Summer Hill, Thornleigh, Penrose, Martins Creek, and most others that do not have a heritage listing. Also look at the size and scope of the article bodies \u2013 often smaller than these articles with less information uniquely relevant to the specific station.\nOnce again, it becomes clear that the GNG is a useful guide, but it is not wholly determinative or infallible \u2013 and it stresses this fact.\nWhat makes these articles different? Will Thorpe (talk) 15:51, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nBe careful with WP:OSE arguments. For instance, if Ashfield railway station came up at AfD, if I looked only at the sources in the article, I would !vote to delete it. SportingFlyer T\u00b7C 17:12, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nTransport for NSW is not an independent source and is thus ineligible for notability discussion. NSWrail is clearly an amateur SPS and so is also ineligible. JoelleJay (talk) 20:56, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse Look, this is way too long of a petition, and the bolding makes it really difficult to read. But it is still a petition. First, it is that there should have been no consensus; second, that this is a continuous area of conflict; third, that the articles were expanded, fourth that other stations articles remain... et cetera. The problem for those wishing to keep the article is that this does appear to have been correctly decided, even ignoring the WP:CANVASSING, and that's because the keep !voters did not accurately identify sources which mean the stations are eligible for standalone articles, and at least two of the delete/redirect !voters noted that sources were not readily available, which weakens the !keep arguments greatly. I also looked at the article under the redirect, and I don't see any clear error having been made here by the !voters. My advice: if there are sources on this specific station, find them, make sure they pass WP:GNG, and then restore the articles. You could do this at AfC, or if you find (multiple) sources and want them reviewed just ping me on my talk page and I will let you know if they are good enough. SportingFlyer T\u00b7C 17:11, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse the close of Redirect as an Alternative to Deletion that was the best close by the closer in this situation:\nThe appellant cites ongoing discussion as a reason not to delete, but is doing much of the discussion, so that this is a filibuster.\nThe appellant says that the articles should be retained, and they are being retained in the article history.\nArbCom recently reaffirmed in the capitalization case that editor time is our most important resource, and the appellant is wasting editor time.  Robert McClenon (talk) 17:59, 25 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nOn your last point, the deletion of multiple articles, in the context of a dispute that has lasted nineteen years, is quite frankly worth at least five minutes of time. @Robert McClenon, forgive my slight disdain for that condescending statement of yours. You might forget that I, too, and a volunteer, with numerous obligations beyond editing this encyclopaedia. Yes, what I wrote was long, but it was done in good faith and intended for your benefit. Will Thorpe (talk) 14:07, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse None of the keep voters provided evidence that the station met WP:GNG or WP:NTRAINSTATION which are the relevant guidelines; the canvassing did not help matters either. The closer was correct in downranking the weaker keeps. Jumpytoo Talk 02:37, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse. You can't both oppose mass AFDs and oppose different articles being listed separately with different outcomes. Stifle (talk) 10:51, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse. The closer appropriately read the consensus in the AfD. Dclemens1971 (talk) 18:39, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse Owen's close as the only possible accurate reading of consensus. Every single keep !vote was devoid of a P&G basis; ignoring them entirely would be perfectly valid. The blatantly LOCALCON, canvassed discussion on the Sydney light rail TP also smacks of WALLEDGARDEN and this topic area should probably get more eyes. JoelleJay (talk) 21:06, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse. The keep advocacy was really weak in their arguments. About the bizarre situation of two articles being redirected whilst others exactly of their kind remain: That's normal. Some Pokemon have separate articles and some don't. Predictably, what appears to have happened is that these other articles of the same kind that \"bizarrely\" still exist as standalone articles have been nominated for deletion following this DRV nomination... \u2014Alalch E. 22:58, 26 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n24 August 2025\n\n\nshow\nPete Tyler \u2013 Vacated and relisted by original closer.

BusterD (talk) 12:53, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNo action. The close was correct, but the page isn't SALTed, and the history is available behind the redirect. The appellant doesn't need our permission to submit a new draft with the added sources, starting from the last revision before the redir (with proper attribution). Or perhaps start a spinout proposal at Talk:WMS Industries. Nothing to undelete, unprotect or overturn here; this isn't DRV business. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 13:34, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNo action. It is not in any way inappropriate to restore the article from underneath the redirect oneself, in a way that (responsibly) addresses the reasons why the AfD decided to redirect.

Robert McClenon (talk) 01:05, 24 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nyeah, go ahead and recreate it. The article is still there underneath the redirect (if you need help getting to it, ask).

Hobit (talk) 02:01, 24 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse the 2020 close, and this should not be at DRV.\nIt sounds like the reason for redirection is overcome.  Options are: Boldly re-create; or if you are not feeling bold, propose re-spinning out at the talk page of the redirect target; or use WP:AfC, draft a new article in draftspace and submit it for review.\nOnly come back to DRV if someone tells you \u201cno\u201d and the is an actual disagreement to look at. SmokeyJoe (talk) 03:41, 24 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse the AfD was correctly closed, but I agree with those above - if you have additional sources it may be worthwhile creating a draft or even reinstating the article, though I'm still not 100% convinced it would survive another AfD.

Additionally, the argument was made that it does not meet WP:GNG. The argument may have been true at the time \u2014 I am not sure \u2014 but as it stands there appear to be a number of reputable, independent sources available, including The Guardian, the Times of India, LBC News, an interview with Telegraf RS, etc. I recommend overturning the decision, or, at least relisting it for further discussion. Coleisforeditor (talk) 23:30, 22 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nEndorse. Are we talking about the same AfD?  The last one, from three years ago, closed as Redirect, not Delete. The canvassing accusation is solidly based on evidence. When an editor's first ever edit in project space, and 15th edit overall, not counting their own userpage, is at AfD, with arguments that have no basis in P&G, I'd say it is safe to assume they were canvassed there. Some of the others don't look much better. I'm not sure the Times of India is exactly the poster child for \"reputable, independent sources\", but the appellant is welcome to submit a fresh draft to AfC, seeing as the current redirect is fully protected (and rightly so). We do not relist a three year old AfD. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 00:12, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nComment The draft was fully rejected last week, so I would say coming here is appropriate. The Guardian source is fresh off the presses and seems very substantive, and along with the other sources in the draft (CNN, Kent Online, maybe the Fox News? depends if you call this politics or not) I could see a case of having another round at AfD. I note from skimming the source headlines, the notability may be more on the founder Daniel Jackson than the micronation he invented. Pinging @Robert McClenon: the AfC reviewer for their awareness. Jumpytoo Talk 01:53, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nComment - It appears that the reason for this Deletion Review is DRV Purpose 3:  Deletion review may be used \u2026 if significant new information has come to light since a deletion that would justify recreating the deleted page;.  This isn't, or shouldn't be, a request to overturn the close due to closer error (which there wasn't), but to reopen the discussion due to new information.\nA report at WP:AN was just closed concerning Verdis and Free Republic of Verdis (two names for the same entity).  A new account was blocked as a sockpuppet account of an account that has been globally locked since 2019 that was pushing publicity about this micronation.\nThere is a long history of sockpuppetry associated with this title.\nIs the appellant asking to reopen the 2019 debate, or for acceptance of the revised draft?  What is the appellant asking for?  Robert McClenon (talk) 06:15, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nRobert McClenon, I am happy to help inexperienced good-faith users navigate the procedural complexity of DRV, but unlike you, I don't think it's our job to second-guess the intentions of an appellant who explicitly disputes the findings of the AfD, not to mention misrepresents its outcome. A good-faith DRVPURPOSE#3 appeal is one that accepts the findings of the AfD, but presents new sources to justify recreation. Three of the four sources presented in this appeal were already included in the draft you rejected, and the fourth is essentially an interview with the founder/president of the micronation. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 09:11, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nUser:OwenX - I didn't see any misrepresentation of the findings of the AFD, but I wasn't looking in detail.  I also  didn't review the sources in the draft in detail.  A reviewer only needs to check the sources if it appears on the face of the draft that the draft may be accepted.  I rejected the draft not because of anything specifically wrong with either the text of the draft or the sources, but because I couldn't accept the draft even if I wanted to, so there was no point in figuring out whether I wanted to accept it.  If I review a draft and the title of the draft is either a hard locked redirect or a hard salted empty title (admin-only), I normally reject it with minimal analysis.  Unless it is obvious to me that the salting was wrong, I don't think that I am being asked to request unprotection or unsalting.  This was such a case.  Robert McClenon (talk) 16:36, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nAre you saying that this appeal misrepresents what the AFD said?  Robert McClenon (talk) 16:36, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nRobert McClenon: the appellant claims the AfD was closed as delete, when in reality it closed as redirect. While several older versions of the page were deleted, including under G4, G5, G8, RfD and one prior AfD, the version nominated in the appealed AfD is still available in the history behind the redirect.\nIf I review a draft and the title of the draft is either a hard locked redirect or a hard salted empty title (admin-only), I normally reject it with minimal analysis - is that standard practice at AfC?  Wouldn't it make more sense to let an admin review it instead?  Or maybe review it on merits, and let an admin unprotect the page if required based on your assessment?  It seems counterproductive to reject a draft simply because a reviewer lacks the permission needed to implement an acceptance. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 17:37, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nUser:OwenX - I view saying that the AFD was closed as Delete when it was actually closed as Redirect, that is, as blank and redirect, is sloppy rather than a misrepresentation.  However, we at DRV are not required to assist sloppy appellants.\nI have been asking at AFC from time to time for years what the standard practice should be in the case of locked redirects.  I have not gotten what I considered a straight answer about the standard practice with locked redirects.  My concerns are, first, that I don't have any assurance that an admin will unlock the redirect even if I ask them to unlock it, and, second, that the locked redirect is often in response to a history of misconduct by originators.  I don't know whether unlocking is supposed to be on the recommendation of a reviewer or whether unlocking is reserved to DRV, which is sometimes is.  My own experience has been that the large majority of drafts for locked redirects are crud, but that is only my comment.  I would appreciate guidance about locked redirects.  Robert McClenon (talk) 18:59, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI'm pretty sure that if an experienced page reviewer like you, Robert McClenon, filed a request to unprotect a page at WP:RFUP, based on your assessment at AfC, it would be promptly carried out by one of the resident admins there. You are as competent as any admin to carry out the log checks, other than viewing deleted revisions, obviously. But if you prefer not to do that, I'd say the best route is to recuse yourself from reviewing drafts when the mainspace page is locked, perhaps pinging one of the admins at AfC to do it instead.  That said, in the specific case of this DRV, I believe the sources identified do not establish notability, and the draft in its current state should be declined, or possibly rejected. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 19:19, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nIn this case, the draft is crud, and I see that I rejected it because it needed either declining or rejecting.  Robert McClenon (talk) 19:06, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nAppellant asking to either overturn or reopen the debate. I was not aware of the draft; I am not particularly well aware on the process for WP:AfC and will not comment on the draft where I do not need to, to avoid unnecessary argument. I do agree that there does appear to be a long history of sockpuppetry, but entirely separate from that, the subject appears to be notable. I have read through the AN and it seems to be more about the block evasion than Verdis itself. Coleisforeditor (talk) 10:29, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nEndorse. The micronation enthusiasts more than anything want a Wikipedia article for their micronation that will have the layout of an article about a country, to give their project the trappings of legitimacy. They want to advertise their \"new country's\" \"Culture\", \"Demographics\", \"Politics\", etc., A country infobox is like an incorpotation certificate. When they have created such a Wikipedia article the micronation is essentially established as it becomes hard to tell the difference between reality and fantasy\u2014visually, it's a country, judging by Wikipedia. Children can be fooled, and other gullible individuals. Ideological opportunists, who may predominantly be of an anarchist or some other very particular ideological orientation, will latch on with trolling questions such as \"what is a country\" (a country is probably that which has a country infobox on Wikipedia). That is why Wikipedia is heavily targeted by micronation enthusiasts. Knowing that they need to meet Wikipedia's notability standard, they indulge in provocations that will cause them to be arrested so that media will cover it, and they will proactively reach out to media outlets feeding them their narrative. So while there is coverage, the narratives in the sources are all dictated by the micronationalists.\u2014Alalch E. 09:51, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nSo, for example: \"Representatives of Verdis, led by the founder and now president Jackson, contacted the editorial staff of Danas to present us with the current situation \u2013 which is the way the Croatian Border Police is treating them.\" They contact the media to place their narratives. \u2014Alalch E. 10:13, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nWell said, Alalch E.. I don't know if micronationalists get themselves arrested specifically to generate SIGCOV, but the rest of it is an accurate description of how WP has become the touchstone for legitimacy of micronations and other fringe social constructs. Owen\u00d7 \u260e 10:30, 23 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI don't remember the detailed reasons, but in about 1996 the project that I was working on tried to define what is a country.

LLM-generated arguments should be excluded from assessments of consensus.\n\n\nThe following discussion has been closed. Please do not modify it.\n\n\n\nI am requesting review of the closure of the AfD for Adeeb Ahamed.\nThe AfD was closed as \u201cdelete,\u201d but this does not reflect a genuine consensus. Several substantive \u201ckeep\u201d arguments were made, supported by reliable sources, yet the outcome appears to have been shaped primarily by the repeated interventions of a single experienced editor arguing for delete. Per WP:CONSENSUS, consensus is not a vote count, but nor is it determined by repetition or seniority. Where multiple good-faith, policy-based arguments remain in conflict, the appropriate result is *no consensus*, not deletion.\nSources and notability  \nDuring the discussion, and in follow-up searches, multiple significant independent sources were identified spanning more than 15 years. Examples include:  \n- The National (2020) \u2014 coverage of Ahamed\u2019s role in hospitality expansion.  \n- The National (2023) \u2014 reporting on financial services expansion into Saudi Arabia and India.  \n- Gulf Business (2020) \u2014 feature interview on the Covid-19 crisis, remittances, and industry outlook.  \n- Gulf Business (2021) \u2014 industry analysis on remittances and digital payments.  \n- Business World (2018) \u2014 analysis of post-GST expansion strategy.  \n- Indian Express (2018) \u2014 reporting on major cultural patronage and civic engagement.  \nTogether with earlier references already cited in the AfD, these sources span a period of well over a decade. That breadth makes it clear this is not a case of routine or trivial mentions, but of sustained, independent editorial interest in the subject\u2019s business trajectory, policy positions, and civic role.  \nThis directly rebuts the claim that coverage is \u201croutine\u201d or \u201cpromotional.\u201d Features in outlets such as Gulf Business, The National, Business World, and Indian Express are independent, reputable, and provide the depth of analysis required under WP:GNG.  \nProcedural concerns  \nAfD exists to test whether notability can be established, not to delete subjects who clearly generate significant coverage but whose articles happen to need improvement. Here, sources establishing WP:GNG were present or easily located, and the discussion reflects ongoing dispute about interpretation, not lack of sourcing. The closure therefore risks confusing \u201clack of unanimity\u201d with \u201cconsensus for delete.\u201d  \nRequest  \nI ask that the close be overturned to *no consensus*. This would reflect the actual balance of arguments, acknowledge the presence of significant sources, and avoid setting an unreasonably high bar for WP:GNG based on one editor\u2019s repeated assertions.

Also, whose to say that Musk wouldn't have quickly returned to brown-nosing Le Grand Orange, and denounced his own plan. See also WP:NOTSNOW and WP:DELPRO#SNOW which explictly says \"This clause should not be used to close a discussion when a particular outcome is merely \"likely\" or \"highly likely\", and there is a genuine and reasoned basis for disagreement.\" and \"It can sometimes be better to allow a few extra days even if current discussion seems very clearly to hold one opinion, to be sure that it really will be a snowball and as a courtesy to be sure that no significant input will be excluded if closed very soon.\" I don't think think a non-admin SNOW close should ever be applied after a few hours, even if there's near unanimity - let alone by a non-admin. Nfitz (talk) 03:02, 16 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI agree on the nonadmin angle. On the SNOW angle, it needed to be closed.  There was zero chance of that AfD changing course to become productive.

The closer should be reminded that if two of your snow closes are challenged in two days, and both challenges have support for the challenge at DRV, maybe you should avoid snow closes for a few months.

Please do not modify it.\n\n\n\nClanker (talk|edit|history|logs|links|watch) (XfD|restore)\nTo preface this, I had initially nominated the article for deletion due to its total lack of sources outside of the timespan of a single week, making it fail WP:SUSTAINED, and, thus, be an open and shut notability failure, as Wikipedia is not news. While the sources were enough to pass WP:GNG, that is not the sole metric of whether an article is encyclopedic enough. However, due to it being a very popular slang word, it was quickly bombarded with many, many keep !votes, many of which were pure votes, as is par for the course on popular pages. Numerous others argued that it passed GNG, which I agreed with, but wasn't the actual crux of my argument at all. While sources were added to the article in the course of the discussion, they didn't address the SUSTAINED issue. One was from 2022, but not actually about the word at all. Of the people who DID acknowledge the argument made in the discussion, a full six people supported temporary draftification, though one person later changed their !vote.\nI expected it to be relisted due to the lack of substance of the keep arguments, which would undoubtedly be seen by a seasoned admin, who would allow more time for the minority view of draftification. However, this closure came out of left field by a non-admin and stated that it was a SNOW keep decision, completely ignoring the draftification !votes, of which there were still several. It did not even mention them at all, or why SUSTAINED was suddenly invalid somehow, making me feel like there was no well-reasoned closure here, and at best it was very rushed. While I attempted to bring up the issue with the closer, they stood heavily behind their decision. At the very least, if this is upheld, I would like the rationale modified to add some sort of policy reason why besides just \"SNOW keep\" and \"Article got expanded since the original deletion nom\", even if the expansion does not address the problem.  \u1d22x\u1d04\u1d20\u0299\u0274\u1d0d (\u1d1b) 21:10, 13 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nRelist or reclose (involved) - reiterating my comment at the closer's talk page, I think that a keep outcome is a reasonable reading of the discussion but the close rationale is insufficient and I don't think SNOW applies, and I question how much article improvement during the AfD really impacted the course of discussion (the other statement in the close). signed, Rosguill talk 21:28, 13 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nReclose as keep with a proper closing statement. Zxcvbnm is right; WP:SNOW is inapplicable here, and the laconic Article got expanded suggests that the earlier calls for draftification became void as soon as someone improved the page, without examining whether those improvements addressed any of the actual concerns. Had I closed this AfD, I would have done so with a detailed statement highlighting the P&G weakness in many (most?) of the Keeps. A vote (yes, not \"!vote\") such as, keep - lack of sustained coverage has not been demonstrated shouldn't even be counted. But in the end, an ATD such as Draftify can only be picked when there is consensus against keeping the page as is. It cannot be chosen as an alternative to retention without consensus, and such consensus did not form in this AfD. And with such broad participation, it is highly unlikely that consensus would have shifted meaningfully with a relist.  Had I closed it, I would have likely added a comment allowing for an early renomination, effectively bringing the result closer to a no-consensus. I know some DRV regulars aren't big fans of my early renomination invitation closes, but I find that a fresh AfD after a month or two often gets clearer consensus than an immediate relist, especially for an AfD that has already been befouled with nonsense votes.

Zx is right that most of the keep !votes were not based on whether the topic meets our PAGs (mostly whether the article meets WP:SUSTAINED), and considering that there were suggestions to draftify the article, the discussion should have been relisted. Just because >80% of the votes were !keep, it does not mean that the article should be kept. What matters in discussions is whether the topic meets our PAGs and most of the !keep votes did not address that.

Given the number of keep !votes that did not address SUSTAINED, and the several that tried to rebut it with essays that misinterpret P&Gs (the burden, as outlined in multiple places in policy, is solidly on those wishing to retain to demonstrate a topic has sustained coverage or is indisputably LASTING; the claim that we should wait until enough time has passed to demonstrate SUSTAINED is not met is directly negated by two policies), the !vote balance is much closer than appropriate for a non-admin and certainly not eligible for SNOW. JoelleJay (talk) 19:27, 20 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nThis misstates the position; it is not that the AfD keep voters presume that all neologisms will have lasting coverage, it is just that for the reasons expressed in WP:NOTTOOSOON, when a neologism has received significant coverage by reliable sources, it is inherently speculative to presume that such coverage will quickly dissipate.

I see rough consensus both that the close as Keep is correct on the merits and that it should not have been made early by a non-admin citing the Snowball Clause.
