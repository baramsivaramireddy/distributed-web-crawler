She first gained media attention as the muse of the fashion designer Alexander McQueen, but received wider notice after she began to appear as an original main cast member on the Bravo reality television series Ladies of London (2014\u20132015).\nNeilson was, briefly, the first wife of Nathaniel Rothschild, 5th Baron Rothschild, from the Rothschild banking family of England. During their marriage, her courtesy title was The Honourable Mrs. Rothschild.\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nIona Annabelle Neilson was born into a wealthy, aristocratic family[2] at King's College Hospital in London, England, on 31 March 1969,[3][4] as the middle child and younger daughter[5] to Maxwell Frederick Neilson, an investment and property advisor,[6] and his wife,[7] Marchesa Elizabetta.[8] She had an elder sister.[9][10]\n\nNeilson (right) and her sister, c.\u20091971\nNeilson split her time between her family's SW3 home, 19 Tedworth Square in Chelsea, London, and her family's country estate, Chiltern House in the Chiltern Hills, near Oxfordshire.[11][12]\n\nEducation[edit]\nNeilson attended at Lady Eden's School on Victoria Road, Kensington, where she was held back a year. At the age of eleven, she joined her sister at Cobham Hall School, a private day and boarding school, housed in Cobham Hall in Gravesend, Kent, where she caught up again.[13] Her school friends included Francesca Amfitheatrof.[14][15] She finished her education with no qualifications at sixteen.[16]\n\n1985 attack in Australia[edit]\nNeilson was randomly attacked by a man during her gap year in Perth, Western Australia, at the age of sixteen. She was tied to a tree and continuously beaten during the attack, which lasted two hours before she broke free. She received facial reconstructive surgery in the aftermath, having been left disfigured.[17][18][19] She fell into a deep depression and became a heroin addict; she was sober by the end of her twenties. She had been travelling in Australia with her paternal cousin, Guy Greville, 9th Earl of Warwick, who owned a fruit-bottling company there.[16] She later said her addiction saved her \"because otherwise I would have killed myself,\".[20][21] Her attacker was later convicted of killing three women.[22][23]\n\nCareer[edit]\nNeilson launched her professional career as a fashion model during her early twenties.[24][25] She became the muse of the fashion designer Alexander McQueen at 22, and continued so until his death in 2010.[26][27][28][29] She was also the muse of John Galliano.[30][31][32][33] She walked in fashion shows for McQueen and Galliano throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.[34][35][36][37][38][39][40]\nNeilson made an unsuccessful attempt at becoming an actress in 2000, after taking several screen tests.[13] She starred in a film to advertise the Alexander McQueen men's collection. The role required her to be nude and to simulate sexual intercourse with a male model.[41]\nNeilson appeared twice in the 2000 VOGUE portfolio, How Many People Does It Take to Make a Dress?, where she depicted designers and their support groups.[42][43][44]\nNeilson was signed to the Sarah Doukas-founded modelling agency Storm Management in 2007.[45]\nNeilson posed for Lee Jenkins wearing Sarabande's Look 42 for the magazine's March 2007 issue.[46]\nNeilson worked as a businesswoman in 2007, recruiting business for the American businessman Carlos Almada's private members' club, Automat on Berkeley Square. She had her business card inscribed to read: 'Annabelle Neilson, Marketing Development Manager'.[16]\nNeilson was the creator and writer of the PBS SoCAL (U.S.) arts and culture documentary series Voces on PBS (2012\u20132019). The series explored the diversity of the Latino cultural experience and was produced by Latino Public Broadcasting.[47]\nNeilson rose to prominence as an original main cast member on the Bravo (U.S.) reality television series Ladies of London.[48][49][50][51] The series chronicled the personal and professional lives of six women who lived in London, as they balanced their social lives, businesses and families.[52][53] The first series premiered on 2 June 2014, with Juliet Angus, Caprice Bourret, Marissa Hermer, Noelle Reno, and Caroline Stanbury,[54] while Luke Henderson served as a recurring cast member.[55] The debut episode attracted 1.17 million viewers.[56] She quickly became a fan favourite.[57][58] She published blogs on BravoTV.com weekly.[59][60][61][62] The finale episode was aired on 21 July 2014.[63] In March 2015, the network renewed the show for a second series.[64] She returned to the main cast.[65] The second series premiered on 7 September 2015,[66] with two new cast members, Caroline Fleming and Julie Montagu, Viscountess Hinchingbrooke.[67] The finale episode aired on 9 November 2015.[68] In December 2015, she announced her departure from the show in a post to her official Instagram account.[69] She appeared in nineteen episodes.[70]\nNeilson mentored the fashion designer Conchita P\u00e9rez for P\u00e9rez's fashion show, which took place in East London.[71] She often modelled at the London Fashion Week clothing trade show.[72]\nNeilson was the author of the Me Me Me children's and teenage, and picture book series. The first instalment, Angry Me (ISBN\u00a09780992872878), was published by Fat Fox Books Ltd on 18 August 2015.[73][74] The second and third instalments, Messy Me (ISBN\u00a09781910884010) and Dreamy Me (ISBN\u00a09781910884027), were both published by Fat Fox Books Ltd on 19 January 2016.[75] Angry Me was about her anger surrounding her struggles with dyslexia, Messy Me was about her sister, and Dreamy Me was about the fantasies she had during her recovery following her horse riding accident.[76]\nNeilson wrote an autobiography, McQueen and I (ISBN\u00a09780753555125), which was published by Virgin Books on 14 February 2016. The book focused on her life with Alexander McQueen.[77][78]\nNeilson made her final on-screen appearance in a cameo role during the biographical documentary film McQueen. Archived footage was also used. The documentary focused on the life and career of Alexander McQueen, and was released during the 2018 Tribeca Festival, on 22 April.[79]\n\nCharity work[edit]\nNeilson modelled in Naomi Campbell's Fashion for Relief fundraiser, in aid of White Ribbon Alliance \u2013 Haiti, at Somerset House on the Strand, London, on 18 February 2010.[80][81][82][83]\nNeilson was involved with the South Africa-based Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. She had been introduced to the charity by Campbell.[84][85]\nNeilson participated in Goodwood Racecourse's all-women's horse race at Ascot Gold Cup on 13 August 2013, in aid of Water, which sponsored a school in Ethiopia. In preparation for the event, she trained at Newmarket Racecourse. Alexander McQueen designed a dress shirt with a skull on both sides for her to wear.[86][87]\nNeilson walked in Campbell's Fashion for Relief fundraiser, in aid of Disasters Emergency Committee \u2013 Ebola, at Somerset House on the Strand on 19 February 2015.[88][89][90][91]\nNeilson wrote a section of the children's book The Curious Tale of Fi-Rex! (ISBN\u00a0978-1910884003), in aid of Children in Need 2015, with other celebrities. The novel focused on a half-girl, half-dragon called Fi-rex, who meets characters and creatures of every type on her quest to find the right way home.[92][93][94][95]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nMarriage[edit]\nNeilson and her partner, British-born Canadian financier Nathaniel Rothschild, 5th Baron Rothschild, from the Rothschild banking family of England, eloped to Las Vegas, Nevada, on 13 November 1995, following a four-year relationship.[96][97][98] The couple first met on a beach in Bali, Indonesia.[99][100] During their marriage, her courtesy title was The Honourable Mrs. Rothschild. \nThey legally separated at Neilson's request in 1997. Their divorce was finalised in 1998, after less than two years of marriage.[a][41][101] She received a substantial out-of-court settlement after signing a confidentiality agreement and agreeing to revert back to her maiden name, having been legally known as Iona Annabelle Rothschild.[102][103]  In 2007, she told TATLER: \"You don't fall in love with a title. You fall in love with a person. And that's all I'm saying. I've never talked about Nat and he's never talked about me. We made an agreement and we've stuck to it. I don't intend to break that promise now.\"[16] Caught off guard by a journalist from the Daily Mail on 25 October 2008, her mother broke ranks to describe her daughter's ex-husband as \"a very naughty boy\", while remembering the \"crazy\" life her daughter was sucked into.[104] In 2014, her ex-husband told the Evening Standard: \"I find it bizarre that I'm still linked with someone I was involved with literally 20 years ago.\"[105]\n\nRelationship with Alexander McQueen[edit]\nNeilson had a close friendship with the fashion designer Alexander McQueen,[106][107] The pair considered each other confidants;[108] he called her Tinkerbell, she called him Lee,[109][110] and she had a bedroom in every home he owned.[111] McQueen's fashion house, Alexander McQueen, dedicated their autumn/winter 1998 show, Joan, to her.[112] In 2000, she was a bridesmaid at McQueen's unofficial Ibiza marriage ceremony to the documentary filmmaker George Forsyth.[113][114]\nNeilson was the last person to see McQueen alive, having left his Green Street, Mayfair home at 3:00 a.m. on 11 February 2010, the day of his suicide.[104][115][116][117] She attended his funeral service, which was held at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, on 25 February 2010, where she read lines from the Edgar Allan Poe poem Annabel Lee.[118][119][120] Throughout March 2010, she paid tribute to McQueen by wearing his distinctive \"manta\" dress.[121] She organised and spoke at his memorial service, held at St Paul's Cathedral on 20 September 2010.[122][123][124] She acted more reserved after McQueen's death.[125][126]\n\nOther relationships[edit]\nNeilson dated the management consultant Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, from the Spencer-Churchill family. Their on-again, off-again relationship started in 2002, and they remained close friends following their 2009 split.[127][128] She attended Spencer-Churchill's civil ceremony to the German photographer Kimberly 'Kimi' Hammerstroem at the Mayfair Library on 4 July 2018,[129] followed by their religious ceremony at Blenheim Palace on 7 July 2018,[130][131][132] her final public appearance in high society.[133][134]\nNeilson and Kate Moss were best friends.[135][136][137][138] She was romantically involved with Jefferson Hack\u2014the father of the model Lila Moss (born Lila Grace Moss Hack)\u2014following Moss and Hack's split. She was Lila's godmother. She had also been romantically linked to Will Ricker, and Karta Healy, the heir to Kettle Crisps.[16] Naomi Campbell was a close friend.[139][140][141]\nNeilson was a close family friend of members of the House of Montagu. John Montagu, 11th Earl of Sandwich,[142] and his wife, Caroline Montagu, Countess of Sandwich looked after her when she was a young girl.[143] She would stay at Mapperton House[144] during the shooting season.[145] She was particularly close with Luke Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke,[146] and his brother, Orlando William Montagu, having met them during her 20s. She later became friends with Viscount Hinchingbrooke's wife, Julie Montagu.[66][147]\n\nLifestyle[edit]\nNeilson was a member of the Primrose Hill set during the 1990s.[148][149][150] She often spent all-nighters at Supernova Heights in Belsize Park, with a selection of her closest friends, including Sadie Frost,[151] Jude Law,[152] Liam Gallagher,[153] Noel Gallagher,[154] Rhys Ifans,[155] Patsy Kensit,[156] Sienna Miller,[157] and Davinia Taylor.[158] She became well known as a socialite,[159][160][161] and was often described as an \"it girl\".[162][163]\nA former heroin addict, she remained sober from 1999 after attending Narcotics Anonymous meetings,[164] though she continued to smoke cigarettes. She occasionally drank alcohol, but preferred a cup of tea or coffee. \n\nOther interests[edit]\nNeilson was an horse racer until 2013, when she was thrown off the saddle at 45 mph, breaking her pelvis. Four ambulances and a helicopter ambulance attended the scene. She was told by doctors that she could never ride again, but regained her ability to walk after twelve weeks.[86][165]\nNeilson enjoyed flying helicopters and swimming with sharks. On separate occasions, she once competed in a rally across the Himalayas during the winter and once rode a motorbike across Australia. As an adult, her favourite books were Seven Pillars of Wisdom by T. E. Lawrence and anything written by Isaac Asimov.[41][13]\n\nDeath[edit]\nNeilson was found dead at her home in Chelsea, London, on the evening of 12 July 2018. She was 49.[166][167][168][169] The London Metropolitan Police said in a statement: \"Police were called by the London Ambulance Service at approximately 22:20 hours on Thursday, 12 July, to a residential address ... after a woman had been found deceased at the location. The death is not being treated as suspicious by police.\"[170][171][172] Her death was announced to the public four days later, on 16 July.[173][174] Susan Lord, a spokesperson for Westminster Coroner's Court revealed her cause of death to be a \"cerebrovascular accident\", or a stroke.[175][176][177] Her family said her cause of death was a heart attack.[178][179][180]\nOn 14 July 2018, two days after her death, a picture of a man in a swimming pool was shared to Neilson's official Instagram account, @annabelleneilson1, with the caption: \"Fatties get in first!\". The posthumous post led her close friends to believe the rumours of her death had been a hoax. Later that same day, a family member cleared her Instagram feed of negative-seeming photographs and captions.[181][182][183]\n\nOn 17 July, Neilson's sister, Millie, released a statement on behalf of her family:[184] Very sadly, we have been informed today that my sister Annabelle, died as a result of a heart attack at home last Thursday. It has come as a complete shock, as she had many plans having recently returned from Spain. My parents and I are devastated and shocked by this news. We would ask the media to respect the privacy of our family and Annabelle's close friends during this very difficult time. We will not be making any further statement at this time. We thank you for your consideration.[185][186]\nTributes and reactions[edit]\nThe fashion house, Alexander McQueen, paid tribute with lines from the Edgar Allan Poe poem Annabel Lee.[187] The Kate Moss Agency paid tribute to Neilson with a broken heart emoji: \"\ud83d\udc94\".[188][189]\nBravo shared in a statement to The Daily Dish: \"We at Bravo are saddened to hear about the passing of Annabelle Neilson who was a dearly loved and respected cast member on two seasons of Ladies of London. We send our deepest sympathies to her family and friends during this very difficult time.\"[190] On 18 July, Andy Cohen opened that night's episode of the Bravo pop culture-based late-night talk show Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen by saying: \"I want to get started with some sad news. We found out that Annabelle from Ladies of London passed away. We just found out today. Don't have a lot of details; we just want to send our love to her family. She was unique and spirited and really wonderful to watch and to know. We're torn up about it here.\"[191]\nNeilson died on her former husband's 47th birthday,[192][193] leading to numerous conspiracy theories,[194][195][196] including conspiracy theories relating to the Rothschild banking family of England.[197]\n\nFuneral[edit]\nNeilson was buried following a private funeral service at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, on 27 July 2018.[198] Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell gave a joint eulogy during the service. Meg Mathews, Orlando Bloom and Liv Tyler attended the funeral.[199]\n\nLegacy[edit]\nNeilson's archive of Alexander McQueen couture was auctioned by Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on 22 September 2020.[200] The auction, titled \"The Annabelle Neilson Collection of Alexander McQueen Auction\", was predicted to raise between \u00a3120,000 and \u00a3180,000.[201][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nBibliography[edit]\nNeilson, Annabelle; Astro (2015).
