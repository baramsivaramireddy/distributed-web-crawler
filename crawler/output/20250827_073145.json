The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone.\u00a0The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing the work, to show a primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for.\u00a0Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the creator providing graphic design services to relevant concerns and video game marketing to the public.\u00a0\n\n\n\nReplaceable?\n\n\nAs cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the item in question would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOther information\n\n\nUse of the cover art in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.\n\n\n\nFair useFair use of copyrighted material in the context of [[]]//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Video_games/Templatestrue\n\nStub types[edit]For a generic stub about computer and video games, use {{videogame-stub}}.
