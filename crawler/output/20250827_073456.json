Even ignoring that actuality (the state of being real) and actual (being real) refer to different things, the \"potentiality and actuality\" article is specifically about 'actuality' as used Aristotelian physics/metaphysics, and not in the general sense. If this is re-targeted, I think Existence is much more suitable. ~ F4U (talk \u2022 they/it) 16:38, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\n\nDelete per nom. Also, it's worth noting that content at this title has been deleted multiple times since 2006. Steel1943 (talk) 18:59, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nOn that note, soft redirect to Wiktionary:actual per the fact content has been repeatedly created at this title. Steel1943 (talk) 19:01, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nPerhaps switch to reality. I am an editor of the article involved (which has however not been much edited for a long time). F4U: As per the 3rd sentence of the article: \"Actuality, in contrast to potentiality, is the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility, when a possibility becomes real in the fullest sense.\" So \"actuality\" in this Aristotelian sense is not \"being real\" even if there is a sort of connection. I think a more suitable adjective for the special Aristotelian term would be something like \"actualized\", \"activated\", or even \"actuated\". The term \"actual\" OTOH might better redirect to reality, rather than existence (or being). Those are two articles and my understanding is that the terms real and actual are more about understanding the character of existence, which is more like the original Aristotelian approach, than trying to grok the contrast between existence/being and non-existence. Reality currently even has a subsection on potentiality and actuality, so that seems a better fit?--Andrew Lancaster (talk) 21:51, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nAll of these options seem to be potentially misleading, considering that the word \"actual\" tends to be an adjective or adverb, all the options for retargeting mentioned here are nouns, and none of the options contain the word \"actual\" anywhere in it (which would establish a strong connection to the redirect.) For these reasons, we cannot assume a reader searching this redirect would be trying to find any of these topics. Steel1943 (talk) 15:54, 15 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nThe concept of actual (from which actuality derives), in the sense of \"existing in acto\", is important and widely used in philosophy. That's why I think the entry should be kept. On the other hand, the problem of lack of context could be solved  by transforming the redirect page into a disambig page (including actual idealism, potentiality and actuality, actual infinity, for instance). Yone (talk) 22:26, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nThat's a bunch of obscure WP:PTMs right there, and those aren't included on disambiguation pages. Wikipedia search results would be more helpful, which can only be accomplished in a clean way if this redirect is deleted. Steel1943 (talk) 02:06, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nI saw this one in the review queue and was planning on nominating it once able to. That being said, a soft redirect to Wiktionary:actual seems suitable here because I'm not convinced there would be an encyclopedic topic that could be sought from \"Actual\".

It can also be found on research papers, such as this one and this one (for instance, With the advent of Structuralism in Brazil in the fifties of the twentieth century and its dissemination in Brazilian universities, many criticisms were directed at Tupinology, i.e. the studies about ancient Tupi and those on Tupi-origin general languages that originated in Brazilian colonial times.

Some people using this might find what they are looking for at Management consulting (where Strategy consulting redirects; strategy consultant is a redlink but arguably should point to the same place), but as there is no content there specific to the automotive industry this wont help everyone. The thing that gives me pause over recommending deletion over the imperfect retarget is that search results for the redirect title don't find the general consulting article, the first two pages are almost exclusively people and companies that have been engaged in some sort of consulting related to the automotive industry rather than the article about the topic/concept that someone using the term is looking for.

Letting you know in the event you desire to change your stance on these redirects since they technically cannot remain in their current state. Steel1943 (talk) 02:37, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDidn't know about that. In that case, retarget Social media forum to Social media and retarget Social bookmarking forum to Social bookmarking. SouthParkFan2006 (talk) 13:04, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nPer WP:SSRT (and the template documentation), {{double soft redirect}} seems intended for linking to sister projects, not to two different articles. I therefore don\u2019t believe these should be kept as is - on the face of it, I\u2019d be tempted to say that I don\u2019t believe there should be double soft redirects in mainspace. I\u2019ll do a bit more digging and will probably add a bolded !vote later for my preference on retargeting/deleting, but I just wanted to get this here first.

(A sistering-page?)  -- 65.92.247.90 (talk) 05:11, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nI\u2019m leaning very weak retarget social media forum to social media, and delete social bookmarking forum (& move the draft currently at Talk:Social bookmarking forum to draftspace). Both terms could be ambiguous (hence why I\u2019m guessing they were created as double redirects), which could cause confusion to readers looking for information on either topic - an X and Y-type situation (potentially engaging WP:R#D1 and D2).My reason for very weakly !voting to retarget social media forum is because I found at least one source using the phrase to refer to social media sites (e.g. [1] - ...the social media forum and discussion site Reddit), as well as the fact that an internet forum could arguably be seen as a type/subtopic of social media (whereas I don\u2019t think internet forums are seen as a type/subtopic of social bookmarking, or vice versa). However, I couldn\u2019t find sources that use the phrase social bookmarking forum in a similar way. (Also, the fact that social bookmarking forum may be an {{R with possibilities}} might also make it worth deleting per WP:R#D10/WP:REDLINK.)Best, user:A\u00a0smart kittenmeow 21:02, 5 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nRetarget both to Internet forum. Internet forums are a medium of social media, which can be shown via swapping \"internet\" and \"social media\" and still communicating the same message. The key identifier in both titles is \"forum\", placed at the end to conclude both search terms. Without this distinction, \"social media\" is just a partial match for the full thing. The equivalent would be having \"internet forum\" target \"internet\"; it loses a significant part of the search term.\nDue to the distinction of \"forum\" at the end of both titles, Internet forum is a much more distinct target than social media is, which is itself a very vague concept in 2023 that covers thousands of apps and websites. Specifying \"forums\" implies seeking the forum subset of social media, where Reddit is mentioned as an internet forum at the target page. To my understanding and history with, all forums are social media, but not all social media are forums. Utopes (talk / cont) 09:19, 6 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDefinitely do not keep as double soft redirects per Smart kitten. I don't find Internet forum a useful target - bookmarking is not mentioned, and the reader doesn't get info on social media forum. Weak retarget social media forum to social media per Smart kitten, infact weak refine to Social media#Definition and features, otherwise delete. Delete Social bookmarking forum as unclear, unless there is a target that talks about it. Move talk page to draftspace per Kitten.

Thanks, CycloneYoris talk! 00:24, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nComment: On a related note, I just nominated Template:Double soft redirect (a template used on both of these nominated redirects) for WP:TFD at Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2023 December 12#Template:Double soft redirect. In addition to questioning this template's utility with these redirects, I'm questioning the template's utility on Wikipedia at all. Steel1943 (talk) 19:48, 12 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nFor what it's worth, Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2023 December 12#Template:Double soft redirect was closed to \"delete\", meaning any \"keep\" or \"no consensus\" result in this RfD discussion with no changes to the redirects is technically invalid, considering the nominated redirects both currently transclude {{Double soft redirect}}. Steel1943 (talk) 02:19, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nRelisted to generate a more thorough discussion and clearer consensus.Relisting comment: Might as well relist this, considering that both of the nominated redirects transclude {{Double soft redirect}}, which is currently being deleted per Wikipedia:Templates for discussion/Log/2023 December 12#Template:Double soft redirect. In other words, there really should not be a lack of consensus (such as what traditionally happens with a \"no consensus\" close of a discussion) since the redirects technically cannot remain in their current state.Please add new comments below this notice. Thanks, Steel1943 (talk) 02:48, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nUpdate regarding this relist: {{Double soft redirect}} has now been deleted. During this process, the templates were completely removed from the nominated redirects, currently leaving the redirects with no target(s). Steel1943 (talk) 19:42, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nRetarget Social media forum to Internet forum; Internet forums are a form of social media, while social media does lots and lots of things that aren't forums (from instant messaging to birthday reminders to photo sharing to whatever). Retarget Social bookmarking forum to Social bookmarking, since that's highly specific, and \"forum\" in this one doesn't mean \"Internet forum\" in the social-networking discussion/chat/debate sense, it means \"venue/hosting provider/conduit/website\". \u2009\u2014\u202fSMcCandlish \u260f \u00a2\u2003\ud83d\ude3c\u2003 11:24, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nPer SMcCandlish, who I think makes reasonable cases for both proposed targets\u2014although I wouldn't lose sleep over the former going to Social media instead.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|she) 20:06, 27 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nThe above is preserved as an archive of the discussion.

I'm created this RFD because I highly question the need for WP:SPECTRUM to point at a bot-dictionary entry about the very niche concept of the spectrum/threshold of usefulness, and cluttering that entry with a hatnote pointing at WP:AUTIST like was done here.\nThis shortcut should be retargeted elsewhere, possibly at WP:AUTIST, or deleted, IMO.

I have a use for it, even if you don't. Whether to have a hatnote at that glossary entry (I removed it again for you since you object to it) has no bearing of any kind on an RfD discussion. There is no deletion rationale here. I wouldn't terribly mind if it were retargeted to the same place WP:AUTIST goes (the place the hatnote referred to), but I'll just end up creating some other shortcut for that glossary item anyway, since I have use of one. PS: \"Hasn't been used anywhere\" is never a rationale for deleting or usurping a new redirect, since they're all always not used yet right after they are created. \u2009\u2014\u202fSMcCandlish \u260f \u00a2\u2003\ud83d\ude3c\u2003 01:48, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nI'd suggest WP:USEFULNESS if you need one.  Headbomb {t \u00b7 c \u00b7 p \u00b7 b} 02:34, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nMaybe, but honestly an argument to ursurp that to redirect to the same target as WP:USEFUL is a lot more compelling than the one to make WP:SPECTRUM go to where WP:AUTIST goes, since the similarity of USEFUL and USEFULNESS is quite close and people might reasonably confuse them. If SPECTRUM gets usurped to go to AUTIST, I'll probably go with something more obscure like WP:SPECUSE or something, so I don't end up right back in RfD again. \u2009\u2014\u202fSMcCandlish \u260f \u00a2\u2003\ud83d\ude3c\u2003 11:36, 20 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDelete per nom.
