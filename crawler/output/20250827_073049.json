English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the global influences of the former British Empire (succeeded by the Commonwealth of Nations) and the United States.[7] It is the most widely learned second language in the world, with more second-language speakers than native speakers. However, English is only the third-most spoken native language, after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish.[8]\nEnglish is either the official language, or one of the official languages, in 57 sovereign states and 30 dependent territories, making it the most geographically widespread language in the world. In the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and New Zealand, it is the dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law.[9] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the de facto lingua franca of diplomacy, science, technology, international trade, logistics, tourism, aviation, entertainment, and the Internet.[10] English accounts for at least 70 percent of total native speakers of the Germanic languages, and Ethnologue estimated that there were over 1.4\u00a0billion speakers worldwide as of 2021[update].[3]\nOld English emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the Anglo-Saxons. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[11][12][13] Then, Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects, which are the source of approximately 28 percent of Modern English words, and from Latin, which is the source of an additional 28 percent.[14] While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages, and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots; it is next-most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian.\n\n\nClassification\nEnglish is a member of the Indo-European language family, belonging to the West Germanic branch of Germanic languages.[15] Old English was one of several languages that emerged from a dialect continuum spoken by West Germanic peoples along the coast of Frisia on the North Sea during the 5th century. Old English and other Anglic languages developed on the British Isles following the migration of speakers there, while the Frisian languages and Old Low German developed in parallel on the continent.[16] Old English evolved into Middle English, which in turn evolved into Modern English.[17] Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including Scots[18] and the extinct Fingallian and Yola dialects of Ireland.[19]\nTraditionally, English and Frisian were considered more closely related to one another than they were to other West Germanic languages, but most modern scholarship dismisses this characterisation of the relationship.[20] Though each exhibited similar sound changes not reflected in other closely related languages around the North Sea at the time, they did not undergo specific changes at the same time as one another\u00a0\u2013 indicating the relationship between Old English and Old Frisian was uncharacteristic of languages that share a unique phylogenetic ancestor.[21][22] Instead, it is likely that the three Ingvaeonic languages\u00a0\u2013 English, Frisian, and Low German\u00a0\u2013 share one common ancestor which acted as a dialect continuum along the North Sea coast, later splitting off into the three languages during the Migration Period, around the 5th century.[16]\nOn the British Isles, English speakers were isolated from the continental Germanic languages and their influences, and their languages diverged considerably as a result. English is not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, as it differs in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology. However, some of these, such as Dutch and Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially in its earlier stages.[23][page\u00a0needed]\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares innovations with other Germanic languages, such as Dutch, German, and Swedish.[24] These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called Proto-Germanic. Features characteristic of the Germanic languages include the division of verbs into strong and weak classes, the use of modal verbs, and the sound changes affecting Proto-Indo-European consonants, known as Grimm's and Verner's laws.[25]\n\nHistory\nMain article: History of English\nProto-Germanic to Old English\nManuscript (written in uncial script) of Beowulf, an epic poem composed in Old English between 975 and 1025. It begins: H\u01bf\u00e6t \u01bf\u0113 G\u0101rde\u00a0/ na ing\u0113ar dagum \u00fe\u0113od cyninga\u00a0/ \u00ferym ge frunon...(\"Listen! We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings...\")\nOld English (also called Anglo-Saxon) was the earliest form of the English language, spoken from c.\u2009450 to c.\u20091150. Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects, sometimes identified as Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic, that were originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.[26] From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, Old English had become dominant in Britain\u00a0\u2013 replacing the Common Brittonic and British Latin previously spoken during the Roman occupation,[27][28][29] which ultimately left little influence on English. England and English (originally \u00c6nglaland and \u00c6nglisc) are both named after the Angles.[30]\nOld English was divided into two Anglian dialects (Mercian and Northumbrian) and two Saxon dialects (Kentish and West Saxon).[31] Through the influence exerted by the kingdom of Wessex, and the educational reforms instated by King Alfred during the 9th century, the West Saxon dialect became the standard written variety.[32] The epic poem Beowulf is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, C\u00e6dmon's Hymn, is written in Northumbrian.[33] Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the Scots language developed from Northumbrian. During the earliest period of Old English, a few short inscriptions were made using a runic alphabet.[34] By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet had been adopted. Written with half-uncial letterforms, it included the runic letters wynn \u27e8\u01bf\u27e9 and thorn \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9, and the modified Latin letters eth \u27e8\u00f0\u27e9, and ash \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9.[34][35]\nOld English is a markedly different from Modern English, such that 21st-century English speakers are entirely unable to understand Old English without special training. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and has a few verb inflections (speak, speaks, speaking, spoke, spoken), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.[36][37][38] Its closest relative is Old Frisian, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other Germanic varieties. Amidst the Danelaw and other Viking invasions, there is evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility into the 9th and 10th centuries, though northern dialects of Old English were likely more similar to Old Norse than southern dialects were. As late as the 10th century, it would have been possible for commoners from certain parts of northern England to converse with those from certain parts of Scandinavia.[39][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed]\n\nInfluence of Old Norse\nBetween the 8th and 11th centuries, the English spoken in some regions underwent significant changes due to contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Several waves of Norsemen colonising the northern British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English speakers in constant contact with Old Norse. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw surrounding York; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. The centre of Norse influence was Lindsey, located in the Midlands. After Lindsey was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity in 920, English spread extensively throughout the region. An element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).[40]\nOther Norse loanwords include give, get, sky, skirt, egg, and cake, typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.[41]\n\nMiddle English\nFurther information: Influence of French on English\n\n\nEnglischmen \u00feeyz hy hadde fram \u00fee bygynnyng \u00fere manner speche, Sou\u00feeron, Northeron, and Myddel speche in \u00fee myddel of \u00fee lond, ...

Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.\n\nJohn Trevisa, c.\u20091385[42]\n\nThe Middle English period is often defined as beginning with the Norman Conquest in 1066. During the centuries that followed, English was heavily influenced by the form of Old French spoken by the new Norman ruling class that had migrated to England (known as Old Norman). Over the following decades of contact, members of the middle and upper classes, whether native English or Norman, became increasingly bilingual. By 1150 at the latest, bilingual speakers represented a majority of the English aristocracy, and monolingual French speakers were nearly non-existent.[43] The French spoken by the Norman elite in England eventually developed into the Anglo-Norman language.[44]  The division between Old to Middle English can also be placed during the composition of the Ormulum (c.\u2009late 12th century), a work by the Augustinian canon Orrm which highlights blending of Old English and Anglo-Norman elements in the language for the first time.[45][46]\nAs the lower classes, who represented the vast majority of the population, remained monolingual English speakers, a primary influence of Norman was as a lexical superstratum, introducing a wide range of loanwords related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.[13] For instance, the French word tr\u00f4ne appears for the first time, from which the English word throne is derived.[47] Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,[48] and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.[49]\nMiddle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (c.\u20091400), and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur (1485). In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.[50] In the first translation of the entire Bible into English by John Wycliffe (1382), Matthew 8:20 reads: \"Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis.\"[51] Here the plural suffix -n on the verb have is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present.\n\nEarly Modern English\nIllustration of the Great Vowel Shift that affected long vowels in Early Modern English. After the highest vowels /i: u:/ broke into diphthongs /ai au/, each of the lower vowels gradually shifted up one level to compensate.\nThe period of Early Modern English, lasting between 1500 and 1700, was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350\u20131700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation. The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.[52][53]\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.[54]\nLiterature in Early Modern English includes the works of William Shakespeare and the 1611 King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn \u0261n sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.[55] In the KJV, Matthew 8:20 reads: \"The Foxes have holes and the birds of the ayre have nests.\"[56] This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order, and the use of of instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (ayre) and word replacements (bird, originally meaning 'nestling', which had replaced Old English fugol).[56]\n\nSpread of Modern English\nBy the late 18th century, the British Empire had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.[57][4] English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.[58][59][60] In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC[61] and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.[62][63] In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.[64]\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755, Samuel Johnson published his Dictionary of the English Language, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.[65]\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now found only in pronouns, such as he and him, she and her, who and whom), and subject\u2013verb\u2013object word order is mostly fixed.[65] Some changes, such as the use of do-support, have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.[66] Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as \"had been being built\" are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media.[67][68][69]\n\nGeographical distribution\nSee also: List of countries and territories where English is an official language, List of countries by English-speaking population, and English-speaking world\n \u00a0\u00a0Majority native language \u00a0\u00a0Co-official and majority native language \u00a0\u00a0Official but minority native language \u00a0\u00a0Secondary language: spoken as a second language by more than 20 percent of the population, de facto working language of government, language of instruction in education, etc. \nEF English Proficiency Index 2019 in Europe:[70] \u00a0\u00a0Very high (63.07\u201370.27) \u00a0\u00a0High (58.26\u201361.86) \u00a0\u00a0Moderate (52.50\u201357.38) \u00a0\u00a0Low (48.69\u201352.39) \u00a0\u00a0Very low (40.87\u201348.19) \u00a0\u00a0Not included in report\nAs of 2016[update], 400\u00a0million people spoke English as their first language, and 1.1\u00a0billion spoke it as a secondary language.[71] English is the largest language by number of speakers, spoken by communities on every continent.[72]\n\nThree circles model\nBraj Kachru has categorised countries into a three circles model, according to how the English is used there:[73]\n\n\"Inner-circle\" countries have large communities of native speakers of English,\n\"Outer-circle\" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and\n\"Expanding-circle\" countries are countries where many people learn English as a foreign language.\nKachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.[74]\nCountries with large communities of native English speakers include the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English\u00a0\u2013 and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the United States (at least 231\u00a0million),[75] the United Kingdom (60\u00a0million),[76][77][78] Canada (19\u00a0million),[79] Australia (at least 17\u00a0million),[80] South Africa (4.8\u00a0million),[81] Ireland (4.2\u00a0million), and New Zealand (3.7\u00a0million).[82] In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.[83] The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.[74]\nEstimates of the numbers of second language and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470\u00a0million to more than 1\u00a0billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.[9] In 2003, David Crystal estimated that non-native speakers outnumbered native speakers by a ratio of three-to-one.[84] In the three circles model, outer-circle countries are countries such as the Philippines,[85] Jamaica,[86] India, Pakistan, Singapore,[87] Malaysia, and Nigeria[88][89] with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.[90]\nThose countries have millions of native speakers on dialect continua ranging from English-based creole languages to more standard varieties of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.[83] Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,[83] and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.[83]\nCountries where English is taught as a foreign language are in the \"expanding circle\".[91] The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.[90] For example, in the Netherlands and some other countries of Europe, an overwhelming majority of the population can speak English,[92] and thus it is often used to communicate with foreigners and in higher education.[93]\n\nPluricentric English\nEnglish is a pluricentric language, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.[94][95][96][97] Spoken English, including English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their accents,[98] but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international standard written English. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.[99]\nAmerican listeners readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.[100] Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.[101]\nThe settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce koin\u00e9 forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.[102] The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers.[75][103]\n\nAustralia has no official languages at the federal or state level.[104]\nIn Canada, English and French share an official status at the federal level.[105][106] English has official or co-official status in six provinces and three territories, while three provinces have none and Quebec's only official language is French.[107]\nEnglish is the official second language of Ireland, while Irish is the first.[108]\nWhile New Zealand is majority English-speaking, its two official languages are M\u0101ori[109] and New Zealand Sign Language.[110]\nThe United Kingdom does not have an official language. In Wales and Northern Ireland, English is co-official alongside Welsh[111] and Irish[112] respectively. Neither Scotland nor England have an official language.\nIn the United States, English was designated the official language of the country by Executive Order 14224 in 2025.[113] English has additional official or co-official status at the state level in 32 states, and all 5 territories;[114] 18 states and the District of Columbia have no official language.\nEnglish as a global language\nMain article: English as a lingua franca\nSee also: Foreign-language influences in English and Study of global communication\nStatus of English in public education by region[115]\u00a0\u00a0Mandatory subject\u00a0\u00a0Optional subject\u00a0\u00a0No data\nEnglish Proficiency Index (2014)[116] \u00a0\u00a0Very high (80\u2013100\u00a0percent) \u00a0\u00a0High (60\u201380\u00a0percent) \u00a0\u00a0Moderate (40\u201360\u00a0percent) \u00a0\u00a0Low (20\u201340\u00a0percent) \u00a0\u00a0Very low (0.1\u201320\u00a0percent) \u00a0\u00a0No data\nModern English is sometimes described as the first global lingua franca,[62][117] or as the first world language.[118][119] English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.[119] Parity with French as a language of diplomacy had been achieved by Treaty of Versailles negotiations in 1919.[120] By the time the United Nations was founded at the end of World War II, English had become pre-eminent;[121] it is one of six official languages of the United Nations.[122] and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.[123] Many other worldwide international organisations, including the International Olympic Committee, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation. Many regional international organisations, such as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),[63] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) use English as their sole working language, despite most members not being countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the EU allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[124] English serves as the basis for the required controlled natural languages[125] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[126] and aviation.[127]\nEnglish is the most frequently taught foreign language in the world.[62][63] Most people learning English do so for practical reasons, as opposed to ideological reasons.[128] In EU countries, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in 19 of the 25 member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and Malta). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.[129] The global influence of English has led to concerns about language death,[130] and to claims of linguistic imperialism,[131] and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however, the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think English provides them with better employment opportunities and increased quality of life.[132]\nWorking knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine[133] and computing. Though it formerly had parity with French and German in scientific research, English now dominates the field.[134] Its importance in scientific publishing is such that over 80 percent of scientific journal articles indexed by Chemical Abstracts in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996, and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.[135]\nAs decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.[59][60][136] For example, English is one of the official languages of India. Many Indians have shifted from associating the language with colonialism to associating it with economic progress.[137] English is widely used in media and literature, with India being the third-largest publisher of English-language books in the world, after the US and UK.[138] However, less than 5 percent of the population speak English fluently, with the country's native English speakers numbering in the low hundreds of thousands.[139][140] In 2004, David Crystal claimed India had the largest population of people able to speak or understand English in the world,[141] though most scholars estimate the US remains home to a larger English-speaking population.[142] Many English speakers in Africa have become part of an \"Afro-Saxon\" language community that unites Africans from different countries.[143]  Regarding its future development, it is considered most likely that English will continue to function as a koin\u00e9 language, with a standard form that unifies speakers around the world.[144]\n\nPhonology\n\n\nThis article contains phonetic transcriptions in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). For an introductory guide on IPA symbols, see Help:IPA.\n\nEnglish phonology and phonetics differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of phonemes (speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.[145] This overview mainly describes Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), the standard varieties of the United Kingdom and the United States respectively.[146][147][148]\n\nConsonants\nMost English dialects share the same 24\u00a0consonant phonemes (or 26, if marginal /x/ and glottal stop /\u0294/ are included). The consonant inventory shown below is valid for California English,[149] and for RP.[150]\n\n\nConsonant phonemes\n\n\n\nBilabial\nLabiodental\nDental\nAlveolar\nPost-alveolar\nPalatal\nVelar\nGlottal\n\n\nNasal\n\n\nm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u014b\n\n\n\n\nPlosive\n\np\nb\n\n\n\n\n\nt\nd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nk\n\u0261\n\n(\u0294)\n\n\n\nAffricate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nt\u0283\nd\u0292\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFricative\n\n\n\nf\nv\n\n\u03b8\n\u00f0\n\ns\nz\n\n\u0283\n\u0292\n\n\n\n(x)\n\n\nh\n\n\n\nApproximant\n\nCentral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u0279\n\n\nj\n\n\nw\n\n\n\n\nLateral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor pairs of obstruents (stops, affricates, and fricatives) such as /p b/, /t\u0283 d\u0292/, and /s z/, the first is fortis (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as /p t\u0283 s/ are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as /b d\u0292 z/, and are always voiceless. Lenis consonants are partly voiced at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as /p/ have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are aspirated [p\u02b0] when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often unreleased [p\u031a] or pre-glottalised [\u0294p] at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: e.g. nip has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, not phonemically) than nib [n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325] (see below).[151]\n\nLenis stops: bin [b\u0325\u026a\u02d1n], about [\u0259\u02c8ba\u028at], nib [n\u026a\u02d1b\u0325]\nFortis stops: pin [p\u02b0\u026an]; spin [sp\u026an]; happy [\u02c8h\u00e6pi]; nip [n\u026ap\u031a] or [n\u026a\u0294p]\nIn RP, the lateral approximant /l/ has two main allophones (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain [l], as in light, and the dark or velarised [\u026b], as in full.[152] GA has dark l in most cases.[153]\n\nClear l: RP light [la\u026at]\nDark l: RP and GA full [f\u028a\u026b], GA light [\u026ba\u026at]\nAll sonorants (liquids /l, r/ and nasals /m, n, \u014b/) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.[154]\n\nVoiceless sonorants: clay [kl\u0325e\u026a\u032f]; snow RP [sn\u0325\u0259\u028a\u032f], GA [sn\u0325o\u028a\u032f]\nSyllabic sonorants: paddle [\u02c8pad.l\u0329], button [\u02c8b\u028ct.n\u0329]\nVowels\n\n\nClosing diphthongs\n\n\nRP\nGA\nWord\n\n\ne\u026a\nbay\n\n\n\u0259\u028a\no\u028a\nroad\n\n\na\u026a\ncry\n\n\na\u028a\ncow\n\n\n\u0254\u026a\nboy\n\n\nCentring diphthongs\n\n\nRP\nGA\nWord\n\n\n\u026a\u0259\n\u026a\u0279\npeer\n\n\ne\u0259\n\u025b\u0279\npair\n\n\n\u028a\u0259\n\u028a\u0279\npoor\n\n\n\n\nMonophthongs\n\n\nRP\nGA\nWord\n\n\ni\u02d0\ni\nneed\n\n\n\u026a\nbid\n\n\ne\n\u025b\nbed\n\n\n\u00e6\nback\n\n\n\u0251\u02d0\n\u0251\nbra\n\n\n\u0252\nbox\n\n\n\u0254, \u0251\ncloth\n\n\n\u0254\u02d0\npaw\n\n\nu\u02d0\nu\nfood\n\n\n\u028a\ngood\n\n\n\u028c\nbut\n\n\n\u025c\u02d0\n\u025c\u0279\nbird\n\n\n\u0259\ncomma\n\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The accompanying table below lists the vowel phonemes in RP and GA, with example words from lexical sets. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.[155]\nIn RP, vowel length is phonemic; long vowels are marked with a triangular colon \u27e8\u02d0\u27e9 in the table above, such as the vowel of need [ni\u02d0d] as opposed to bid [b\u026ad].[156] In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.[157]\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically shortened before fortis consonants in the same syllable, like /t t\u0283 f/, but not before lenis consonants like /d d\u0292 v/ or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of rich [r\u026at\u0283], neat [nit], and safe [se\u026a\u032ff] are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ridge [r\u026a\u02d1d\u0292], need [ni\u02d1d], and save [se\u02d1\u026a\u032fv], and the vowel of light [la\u026a\u032ft] is shorter than that of lie [la\u02d1\u026a\u032f]. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.[158]\nThe vowel /\u0259/ only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.[159][160] Some dialects do not contrast /\u026a/ and /\u0259/ in unstressed positions, such that rabbit and abbot rhyme and Lenin and Lennon are homophonous, a dialectal feature called the weak vowel merger.[161] GA /\u025cr/ and /\u0259r/ are realised as an r-coloured vowel [\u025a], as in further [\u02c8f\u025a\u00f0\u025a] (phonemically /\u02c8f\u025cr\u00f0\u0259r/), which in RP is realised as [\u02c8f\u0259\u02d0\u00f0\u0259] (phonemically /\u02c8f\u025c\u02d0\u00f0\u0259/).[162]\n\nPhonotactics\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in sprint /spr\u026ant/, and end with up to five, as in (for some dialects) angsts /a\u014bksts/. This gives an English syllable a structure of (CCC)V(CCCCC)\u00a0\u2013 where C represents a consonant and V a vowel. The word strengths /str\u025b\u014bk\u03b8s/ is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in play; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in fly or sly; s and a voiceless stop, as in stay; and s, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in string.[163] Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Several consonants have limited distributions: /h/ can only occur in syllable-initial position, and /\u014b/ only in syllable-final position.[164]\n\nStress, rhythm, and intonation\nSee also: Stress and vowel reduction in English, Intonation (linguistics) \u00a7\u00a0English, and English prosody\nStress plays an important role in English. Certain syllables are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently reduced while vowels in stressed syllables are not.[165]\nStress in English is phonemic, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word contract is stressed on the first syllable (/\u02c8k\u0252ntr\u00e6kt/ KON-trakt) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (/k\u0259n\u02c8tr\u00e6kt/ k\u0259n-TRAKT) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.[166][167][168] Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel /\u0252/, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to /\u0259/. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. \"a burnout\" (/\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rna\u028at/) versus \"to burn out\" (/\u02c8b\u025c\u02d0rn \u02c8a\u028at/), and \"a hotdog\" (/\u02c8h\u0252td\u0252\u0261/) versus \"a hot dog\" (/\u02c8h\u0252t \u02c8d\u0252\u0261/).[169]\nIn terms of rhythm, English is generally described as a stress-timed language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.[170] Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.[171]\n\nRegional variation\n\nPhonological features in Standard English varieties[172]\nhide\n\n\nUnitedStates\nCanada\nRepublicof Ireland\nNorthernIreland\nScotland\nEngland\nWales\nSouthAfrica\nAustralia\nNewZealand\n\n\nfather\u2013bother merger\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\u0252/ is unrounded\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/\u025cr/ is pronounced [\u025a]\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncot\u2013caught merger\n\nPossibly\nYes\nPossibly\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfool\u2013full merger\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/t, d/ flapping\n\nYes\nYes\nPossibly\nOften\nRarely\nRarely\nRarely\nRarely\nYes\nOften\n\n\ntrap\u2013bath split\n\n\n\nPossibly\nPossibly\n\nOften\nYes\nYes\nOften\nYes\n\n\nnon-rhoticity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nclose vowels for /\u00e6, \u025b/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\n/l/ can always be pronounced [\u026b]\n\nYes\nYes\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\n/\u0251\u02d0/ is fronted before /r/\n\n\nPossibly\nPossibly\n\n\n\n\n\nYes\nYes\n\n\nDialects and low vowels\n\n\nLexical set\nRP\nGA\nCan\nSound change\n\n\nTHOUGHT\n\n/\u0254\u02d0/\n/\u0254/ or /\u0251/\n/\u0251/\ncot\u2013caught merger\n\n\nCLOTH\n\n/\u0252/\nlot\u2013cloth split\n\n\nLOT\n\n/\u0251/\nfather\u2013bother merger\n\n\nPALM\n\n/\u0251\u02d0/\n\n\nBATH\n\n/\u00e6/\n/\u00e6/\ntrap\u2013bath split\n\n\nTRAP\n\n/\u00e6/\n\nVarieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best-known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and South Africa have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally.[172]\nEnglish has undergone many historical sound changes, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the Great Vowel Shift, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the Northern Cities Vowel Shift and Canadian Shift have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.[173]\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and phones than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a voiceless [\u028d] sound in whine that contrasts with the voiced [w] in wine, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced [w], a dialect feature called wine\u2013whine merger. The voiceless velar fricative sound /x/ is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes loch /l\u0254x/ from lock /l\u0254k/. Accents like Cockney with \"h-dropping\" lack the glottal fricative /h/, and dialects with th-stopping and th-fronting like African-American Vernacular and Estuary English do not have the dental fricatives /\u03b8, \u00f0/, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops /t, d/ or labiodental fricatives /f, v/.[174][175] Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as yod-dropping, yod-coalescence, and reduction of consonant clusters.[176][page\u00a0needed]\nGA and RP vary in their pronunciation of historical /r/ after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the syllable coda). GA is a rhotic dialect, meaning that it pronounces /r/ at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses /r/ in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide /r/ like RP or keep it like GA.[177]\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the open front and open back vowels /\u00e6 \u0251\u02d0 \u0252 \u0254\u02d0/. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three /\u00e6 \u0251 \u0254/,[178] and in Canadian English, they merge to two /\u00e6 \u0251/.[179]\n\nGrammar\nTypical for an Indo-European language, English grammar follows accusative morphosyntactic alignment. Unlike other Indo-European languages, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.[180] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.[181]\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected strong stems inflected through ablaut (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs speak\u00a0/ spoke and foot\u00a0/ feet) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as love\u00a0/ loved, hand\u00a0/ hands).[182] Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (he\u00a0/ him, who\u00a0/ whom); similarly, traces of more complex verb conjugation are seen in the inflection of the copula verb to be.[182]\nThe seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:[183]\n\n\n\nThe\nchairman\nof\nthe\ncommittee\nand\nthe\nloquacious\npolitician\nclashed\nviolently\nwhen\nthe\nmeeting\nstarted.\n\n\nDet.\nNoun\nPrep.\nDet.\nNoun\nConj.\nDet.\nAdj.\nNoun\nVerb\nAdvb.\nConj.\nDet.\nNoun\nVerb\n\nNouns and noun phrases\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into proper nouns (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into count nouns and mass nouns.[184]\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural suffix -s, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. \"one loaf of bread\", \"two loaves of bread\".[185]\nRegular plural formation:\n\nSingular: cat, dog\nPlural: cats, dogs\nIrregular plural formation:\n\nSingular: man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse\nPlural: men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe. If the noun is plural formed with -s the apostrophe follows the -s.[181]\nPossessive constructions:\n\nWith -s: \"The woman's husband's child\"\nWith of: \"The child of the husband of the woman\"\nNouns can form noun phrases (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.[186] Noun phrases can be short, such as the man, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. \"the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles\" (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.[181] For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in \"The President of India's wife\", where the enclitic follows India and not President.\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of definiteness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but all men (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.[187]\n\nAdjectives\nEnglish adjectives are words such as good, big, interesting, and Canadian that most typically modify nouns, denoting characteristics of their referents (e.g. \"a red car\"). As modifiers, they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.[188] English adjectives also function as predicative complements (e.g. \"the child is happy\").\nIn Modern English, adjectives are not inflected so as to agree in form with the noun they modify, as in most other Indo-European languages. For example, in the phrases \"the slender boy\", and \"many slender girls\", the adjective slender does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\nSome adjectives are inflected for degree of comparison, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix -er marking the comparative, and -est marking the superlative: \"a small boy\", \"the boy is smaller than the girl\", \"that boy is the smallest\". Some adjectives have irregular suppletive comparative and superlative forms, such as good, better, and best. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by periphrastic constructions, with the adverb more marking the comparative, and most marking the superlative: happier or more happy, the happiest or most happy.[189] There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.[190]\n\nDeterminers\nEnglish determiners are words such as the, each, many, some, and which, occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as definite or indefinite.[191] They often agree with the noun in number. They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison.\n\nPronouns, case, and person\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them) as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing it from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns) and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular (distinguishing between feminine she/her, epicene they/them, and masculine he/him.[192][193] The subjective case corresponds to the Old English nominative case, and the objective case is used in the sense both of the previous accusative case (for a patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and of the Old English dative case (for a recipient or indirect object of a transitive verb).[194][195] The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, otherwise the objective is used.[196] While grammarians such as Henry Sweet[197] and Otto Jespersen[198] noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin-based system, some contemporary grammars, for example Huddleston & Pullum (2002), retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. \"the chair is mine\").[199] Grammatical person in English no longer distinguishes between formal and informal pronouns of address, with the second person singular familiar pronoun thou that previously existed in the language having fallen almost entirely out of use by the 18th century.[200]\nBoth the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular:\n\nPlural and singular are always identical (you, your, yours) in the second person (except in the reflexive form: yourself/yourselves) in most dialects. Some dialects have introduced innovative second person plural pronouns, such as y'all (found in Southern American English and African-American Vernacular English), youse (found in Australian English), or ye (in Hiberno-English).\nIn the third person, the they/them series of pronouns (they, them, their, theirs, themselves) are used in both plural and singular, and are the only pronouns available for the plural. In the singular, the they/them series (sometimes with the addition of the singular-specific reflexive form themself) serve as a gender-neutral set of pronouns. These pronouns are becoming more accepted, especially as part of the LGBTQ culture.[192][201][202]\n\nEnglish personal pronouns\n\n\nPerson\nSubjective case\nObjective case\nDependent possessive\nIndependent possessive\nReflexive\n\n\n1st, singular\n\nI\nme\nmy\nmine\nmyself\n\n\n2nd, singular\n\nyou\nyou\nyour\nyours\nyourself\n\n\n3rd, singular\n\nhe/she/it/they\nhim/her/it/them\nhis/her/its/their\nhis/hers/its/theirs\nhimself/herself/itself/themself/themselves\n\n\n1st, plural\n\nwe\nus\nour\nours\nourselves\n\n\n2nd, plural\n\nyou\nyou\nyour\nyours\nyourselves\n\n\n3rd, plural\n\nthey\nthem\ntheir\ntheirs\nthemselves\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities deictically or anaphorically. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation\u00a0\u2013 for example, the pronoun I identifies the speaker, and the pronoun you, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as that refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence \"I already told you that\". The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").[203]\n\nPrepositions\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. \"with the dog\", \"for my friend\", \"to school\", \"in England\".[204] English prepositions have a wide range of uses\u00a0\u2013 including describing movement, place, and other relations between entities, as well as functions that are syntactic in nature, like introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.[204] For example, in the phrase \"I gave it to him\", the preposition to marks the indirect object of the verb to give. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.[205]\n\nVerbs and verb phrases\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with a third person present singular subject. Only the copula verb to be is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.[189] Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.[206][207]\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.[208] The copula verb to be is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present form is am, the third person singular form is is, and the form are is used in the second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.\n\n\nEnglish inflectional forms\n\n\nInflection\nStrong\nRegular\n\n\nPlain present\n\ntake\nlove\n\n\n3rd person sg.present\n\ntakes\nloves\n\n\nPreterite\n\ntook\nloved\n\n\nPlain (infinitive)\n\ntake\nlove\n\n\nGerund\u2013participle\n\ntaking\nloving\n\n\nPast participle\n\ntaken\nloved\n\nTense, aspect, and mood\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterite) and non-past. The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix -ed, and for the strong verbs either the suffix -t or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix -s.[206]\n\n\n\n\nPresent\nPreterite\n\n\nFirst person\n\nI run\nI ran\n\n\nSecond person\n\nYou run\nYou ran\n\n\nThird person\n\nJohn runs\nJohn ran\n\nEnglish does not have future verb forms.[209] The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs will or shall.[210] Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb \"be going to\" (going-to future).[211]\n\n\n\n\nFuture\n\n\nFirst person\n\n\"I will run\"\n\n\nSecond person\n\n\"You will run\"\n\n\nThird person\n\n\"John will run\"\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs, primarily have and be, which show the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (\"I have run\" vs. \"I was running\"), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (\"I had been running\") and present perfect (\"I have been running\").[212]\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There are also subjunctive and imperative moods, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), for use in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: \"It is important that he run every day\"; imperative Run!).[210]\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition to, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.[213] For example, \"he has to go\" where only the auxiliary verb have is inflected for time and the main verb to go is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as \"I saw him leave\", where the main verb is see, which is in a preterite form, and leave is in the infinitive.\n\nPhrasal verbs\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called phrasal verbs, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are \"to get up\", \"to ask out\", \"to get together\", and \"to put up with\". The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment).[214] In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston & Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, e.g. \"he woke up in the morning\" and \"he ran up in the mountains\" are syntactically equivalent.\n\nAdverbs\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.[181] Many English adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix -ly. For example, in the phrase \"the woman walked quickly\", the adverb quickly is derived from the adjective quick. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good, which has the adverbial form well.[215]\n\nSyntax\nIn the English sentence \"The cat sat on the mat\", the subject is the cat (a noun phrase), the verb is sat, and on the mat is a prepositional phrase composed of a noun phrase the mat, headed by the preposition on.\nModern English syntax is moderately analytic.[216] It has developed features such as modal verbs and word order as resources for conveying meaning. Auxiliary verbs mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the passive voice and progressive aspect.[217]\n\nBasic constituent order\nEnglish has moved from the Germanic verb-second (V2) word order to being almost exclusively subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO).[218] The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as \"he had hoped to try to open it\".\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.[219] The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\n\n\nThe dog\nbites\nthe man\n\n\nS\nV\nO\n\n\nThe man\nbites\nthe dog\n\n\nS\nV\nO\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.[220] The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n\n\nHe\nhit\nhim\n\n\nS\nV\nO\n\nIndirect objects (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as \"I gave Jane the book\" or in a prepositional phrase, such as \"I gave the book to Jane\".[221]\n\nClause syntax\nMain article: English clause syntax\nEnglish sentences may be composed of one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any noun or prepositional phrases. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase \"I think (that) you are lying\", the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause \"(that) you are lying\". The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.[222] Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence \"I saw the letter that you received today\", the relative clause \"that you received today\" specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom, and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted).[223] In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.[224]\n\nAuxiliary verb constructions\nEnglish auxiliary verbs are relied upon for many functions, including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence \"the dog did not find its bone\", the clause \"find its bone\" is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject\u2013auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.[225]\nThe verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I did shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *\"I know not\"\u00a0\u2013 it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like \"I do not (don't) know.\" The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions\u00a0\u2013 inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *\"Know you him?\"; grammatical rules require \"Do you know him?\"[226]\nNegation is done with the adverb not, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not -n't can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb to be. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English \"I don't know him\" is the correct answer to the question \"Do you know him?\", but not *\"I know him not\", although this construction may be found in older English.[227]\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get. For example, putting the sentence \"she sees him\" into the passive becomes \"he is seen (by her)\", or \"he gets seen (by her)\".[228]\n\nQuestions\nBoth yes/no questions and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject\u2013auxiliary inversion (\"Am I going tomorrow?\", \"Where can we eat?\"), which may require do-support (\"Do you like her?\", \"Where did he go?\"). In most cases, interrogative words (or wh-words)\u00a0\u2013 which include who, what, when, where, why, and how\u00a0\u2013 appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question \"What did you see?\", the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs (e.g. \"Who saw the cat?\"). Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the questions theme (e.g. \"To whose house did you go last night?\"). The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.[229]\n\nDiscourse level syntax\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic\u2013comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, \"the girl was stung by the bee\". Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. \"it was the girl that the bee stung\", \"there was a girl who was stung by a bee\".[230] Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g. \"it is raining\") or in existential clauses (\"there are many cars on the street\"). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic\u2013comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\nFocus constructions emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, \"the girl was stung by a bee\" (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or \"the girl was stung by a bee\" (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).[231] Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, \"That girl over there, she was stung by a bee\", emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, \"she was stung by a bee, that girl over there\", where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought.[232]\nCohesion between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. \"that is exactly what I mean\" where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).[233] Discourse markers such as oh, so, or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, \"no way is that true!\" (the idiomatic marker \"no way!\" expressing disbelief), or \"boy! I'm hungry\" (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.[234]\n\nVocabulary\nThe English lexicon consists of around 170,000 words (or 220,000, if counting obsolete words), according to an estimate based on the 1989 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary.[235] Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1\u00a0million words\u00a0\u2013 but that count presumably includes words such as Latin species names, scientific terminology, botanical terms, prefixed and suffixed words, jargon, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical acronyms.[236]\nEnglish adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora,[237] collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analyses of linguistic corpus data become available.[238][239]\n\nWord-formation processes\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,[240] using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,[236][239] producing compound words such as babysitter or ice cream or homesick.[240]\nFormation of new words, called neologisms, based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example television or optometry) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, American lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the \"international scientific vocabulary\" (ISV) when compiling Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is that of acronyms, which result from pronouncing abbreviations of longer phrases as single words, e.g. NATO, laser, scuba.[241]\n\nWord origins\nMain articles: Foreign-language influences in English and Lists of English words by country or language of origin\nSee also: Linguistic purism in English\n\n\nEnglish lexicon by source language[11][242]\n\nFrench, including Anglo-Norman (28.3%)\nLatin, including modern scientific and technical Latin (28.2%)\nGermanic languages (Old English, Old Norse, Dutch) (25.0%)\nGreek (5.32%)\nNo etymology given (4.03%)\nDerived from proper names (3.28%)\nOther (5.83%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglish, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000\u00a0years.[243] Nevertheless, most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic.[244][245] The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from Old English.[236] It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords.[246]\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of Latinate words (especially derivations from French and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.[247] Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without orthographical change by French speakers.[248] Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and northern England. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as egg and knife.[249]\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.[239][236] Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.[250] English continues to gain new loanwords and calques (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.[251]\nEnglish has formal and informal speech registers; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.[252][253]\n\nEnglish loanwords and calques in other languages\nMain article: Englishisation\nSign written in United States Spanish, using the English word free instead of the Spanish gratis\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.[247][254] The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.[255] That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.[256] Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.[257] Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.[257]\n\nOrthography\nSince the 9th century, English has been written using the English alphabet, which uses the Latin script. Anglo-Saxon runes were previously used to write Old English, but only in short inscriptions; the overwhelming majority of attested writings in Old English are in the Old English Latin alphabet.[34]\nEnglish orthography is multi-layered and complex, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.[258] Further complications have arisen through sound changes with which the orthography has not kept pace.[52] Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.[259] There are also systematic spelling differences between British and American English. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.[260]\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.[261] Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling\u00a0\u2013 for example, the words photograph, photography, and photographic,[261] or the words electricity and electrical. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",[258] there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.[262] The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.[263] Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.[264]\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or digraphs used to spell consonant sounds. The letters b, d, f, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, y, z represent, respectively, the phonemes /b, d, f, h, d\u0292, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/. The letters c and g normally represent /k/ and /\u0261/, but there is also a soft c pronounced /s/, and a soft g pronounced /d\u0292/. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters c and g are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /t\u0283/, sh for /\u0283/, th for /\u03b8/ or /\u00f0/, ng for /\u014b/, qu for /kw/, and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin[261] or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.[265]\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (a, e, i, o, u, y, and very rarely w). As a result, some \"long vowels\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the oa in boat, the ow in how, and the ay in stay), or the historically based silent e (as in note and cake).[262]\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.[266] Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.[261] Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.[267][268] Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.[269]\nEnglish writing also includes a system of punctuation marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.[270]\n\nDialects, accents, and varieties\nDialectologists identify many English dialects, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British English (BrE) and North American English (NAE).[271] There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand English.\n\nBritain and Ireland\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech example\nDuration: 41 seconds.0:41\nAn example of a man with a contemporary Received Pronunciation accent (Alain de Botton).\nProblems playing this file?

The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the 1950\u201361 Survey of English Dialects, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.[273]\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary. In fact, only 3% of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.[274] There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.[275] Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class; some traits, though exceedingly common, are nonetheless considered \"non-standard\" and associated with lower-class speakers and identities. An example of this is h-dropping, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England. However, it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.[276]\nEnglish in England can be divided into four major dialect regions: South East English, South West English (also known as West Country English), Midlands English and Northern English. Within each of these regions, several local dialects exist: within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects, the Geordie dialect (spoken around Newcastle, in Northumbria) and the Lancashire dialects, which include the urban subdialects of Manchester (Mancunian) and Liverpool (Scouse). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking invasions of England, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.[277] In the West Midlands, dialects such as Black Country (Yam Yam), and by less extent Birmingham (Brummie), preserve archaic features from Early Modern and Middle English, retaining Germanic elements such as specific grammatical structures and vocabulary.[278]\nSince the 15th century, South East England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the Cockney dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.[279][280][281] Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of intrusive R (drawing is pronounced \"drawring\" /\u02c8dr\u0254\u02d0r\u026a\u014b/), t-glottalisation (Potter is pronounced with a glottal stop as Po'er /\u02c8p\u0252\u0294\u0259/) and th-fronting, or the pronunciation of th- as /f/ (thanks pronounced \"fanks\") or /v/ (bother pronounced \"bover\").[282]\nScots is today considered a separate language from English, but it has its origins in early Northern Middle English[283] and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scottish Gaelic and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. In addition to Scots, Scottish English comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.[284]\nIn Ireland, various forms of English have been spoken following the Norman invasion of the island during the 11th century. In County Wexford and in the area surrounding Dublin, two extinct dialects known as Forth and Bargy and Fingallian developed as offshoots from Early Middle English and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern Irish English, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into Ulster English, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the rhoticity which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.[19][285]\n\nNorth America\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech example\nDuration: 57 seconds.0:57\nAn example of a Midwestern American man with a General American accent (Emery Emery).\nProblems playing this file?

However, modern scholars have strongly opposed this notion, arguing that North American English shows a great deal of phonetic, lexical, and geographic variability. This becomes all the more apparent considering social, ethnolinguistic, and regional varieties such as African-American English, Chicano English, Cajun English, or Newfoundland English.[286] American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,[287] though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,[288] known collectively as General American English (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves, including Midland and Western American English.[289][290][291]\nCanadian English varieties, excepting those from Atlantic Canada and possibly Quebec, are generally considered to belong to the GA continuum, although they often show raising of the vowels /a\u026a/ and /a\u028a/ before voiceless consonants and have distinct norms for writing and pronunciation as well.[292] Atlantic Canadian English, notably distinct from Standard Canadian English,[293] comprises Maritime English and Newfoundland English. It was influenced mostly by British and Irish English, as well as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Acadian French.[294]\nIn most American and Canadian English dialects, rhoticity (or r-fullness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (or r-dropping) being associated with lower prestige and social class, especially since the end of World War II. This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.[295] Varieties beyond GA which have developed distinct sound systems include the Southern American English, New York City English, Eastern New England English, and African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) groups\u00a0\u2013 all of which are historically non-rhotic, save a few varieties of Southern American.\nIn Southern American English, the most populous grouping outside GA,[296] rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's historical non-rhotic prestige.[297][298][299] Southern accents are colloquially described as a \"drawl\" or \"twang\",[300] being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by glide-deleting in the /a\u026a/ vowel (e.g. pronouncing spy almost like spa), the \"Southern breaking\" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word press almost like \"pray-us\"),[301] the pin\u2013pen merger, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.[302]\nSpoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is largely non-rhotic, and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,[303] contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or English-based creole to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.[304] AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of \"broken\" or \"uneducated\" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.[305][306]\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech example\nDuration: 17 minutes and 36 seconds.17:36\nAn example of a man with a general Australian accent.\nProblems playing this file?

The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.[307] Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of South East England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb, e.g. \"the government is\" (rather than are).[308][309] New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.[310][311][312]\n\nSoutheast Asia\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech example\nDuration: 19 minutes and 35 seconds.19:35\nAn example of a male teenager with a Singaporean accent.\nProblems playing this file?

In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about nine percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety that tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. The second-language varieties of South Africa differ based on the native languages of their speakers.[315] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[316] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [p\u026an] rather than as [p\u02b0\u026an] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [\u027e] instead of as the more common fricative.[317]\nNigerian English is a variety of English spoken in Nigeria; over 150\u00a0million Nigerians speak some form of the language.[318] Though traditionally based on British English, increasing United States influence during the latter 20th century has resulted in American English vocabulary entering Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the variety out of a need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. senior wife).[319]\nVarieties of English are spoken throughout the former British colonial possessions in the Caribbean, including Jamaica, the Leeward and Windward Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Cayman Islands, and Belize. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.[320] Residents are often fluent in both the local English variety and the local creole languages, and frequently code-switch between them. The relationship between different varieties can be conceptualised as a continuum, in which more creole-like or RP-like forms function as more formal and informal registers of the language respectively.[321]\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs /ei/ and /ou/ are monophthongs [e\u02d0] and [o\u02d0] or even the reverse diphthongs [ie] and [uo] (e.g. bay and boat pronounced [b\u02b2e\u02d0] and [b\u02b7o\u02d0t]). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced [t\u0361\u0283ail] and \"wind\" [win].[322][323][324]\nIndian English historically tends towards RP as an ideal, with the proximity of speakers to RP generally reflective of class distinctions. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as /t/ and /d/ (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as [\u0288] and [\u0256]) and the replacement of /\u03b8/ and /\u00f0/ with dentals [t\u032a] and [d\u032a]. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling-based pronunciations where the silent \u27e8h\u27e9 found in words such as ghost is pronounced as an Indian voiced aspirated stop [\u0261\u02b1].[325]\n\nNon-native varieties\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech example\nDuration: 18 seconds.0:18\nAn example of a Hispanophone man speaking English.\nProblems playing this file?

This can happen either because they apply the speech rules of their mother tongue to English (\"interference\") or through implementing strategies similar to those used in first language acquisition. They may create novel pronunciations for English sounds not found in their first language.[326]\n\nSee also\nEnglish-only movement\nEnglish in the Commonwealth of Nations\nReferences\n\n\n^ Oxford Learner's Dictionary 2015, Entry: English \u2013 Pronunciation.\n\n^ \"What are the top 200 most spoken languages?\".
