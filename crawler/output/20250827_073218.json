Thanks! W9793 (talk) 02:16, 14 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi, these are a bit outside my area of competence. Something that will be raised as a problem with both articles is that they look a bit like government websites. I'd suggest restructuring them more as encyclopaedia articles, which would likely involve reducing the length. The lead of the Global Engagement Center article seems too short and it doesn't really summarise the full article at present - e.g. it doesn't discuss the criticism and commentary this centre received. Some elements of both articles seem over-referenced - in general there should be no references in the lead, and especially not multiple references for basic facts. The Global Music Diplomacy Initiative article also doesn't answer the fundamental question of why it exists given that the US music industry is dominant across much of the world and doesn't seem to need the government to promote it or encourage it along. Is the idea to better leverage the sector in countries where US musicians don't regularly tour or similar? Regards, Nick-D (talk) 10:14, 14 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nThis is helpful - I will perhaps try doing some initial revision later - thank you! W9793 (talk) 16:34, 14 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nCopyvio deletion requests[edit]\nHi Nick!! Happy New Year!! Both Rhode Island World War II Army Airfields and West Virginia World War II Army Airfields are old articles by Bwmoll3, implicated in his staggeringly large copyvio problem that still remains to be fully addressed. They're also both useless template articles, a listing of airfields by state that for both these states only involves one repeat one airfield - not the 50+ in states like California. Would you be happy to delete them for me or should I follow some more elaborate process? Kind regards, Buckshot06 (talk) 09:25, 29 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi, and happy new year to you! Are these confirmed copyright violations? If not, prod deletions would probably be the best option here. Regards, Nick-D (talk) 09:30, 29 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nCan I contribute to The Bugle Feb 2025 issue?[edit]\nHi Nick, I would like to contribute an essay and two book reviews to the upcoming February 2025 issue of The Bugle. To that object, I have added the 8 featured articles promoted in January 2025 to the newly promoted articles page. Please let me know if that edit is alright, and if I can contribute the essay and book reviews. Matarisvan (talk) 11:09, 30 January 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nMentor for FAC[edit]\nHello! I Hope you're doing well. \nI've been working on bringing up a page, Sher Shah Suri, fairly relevant in your area of expertise being military history. I saw you as possibly available at WP:FAM. Was wondering if you could help me improve this page to bring it further to Featured Article standard? Have done nominations before for it (and got rejected) but improved the article off of it, including a peer review. [1]\nBest wishes. Noorullah (talk) 05:33, 5 February 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi Noorullah, I'd normally say yes and provide an informal peer review, but I'm quite busy with work and personal commitments at the moment, so won't be able to do this.

Your editors, Ian Rose (talk) and Nick-D (talk) 12:09, 12 February 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\n\nCanberra International Airport[edit]\nHello there. Noting you re-added Canberra Airport to the category \"International Airports in Australia\", you may be interested to note the ongoing discussion at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2025 February 9. Please note I am an involved editor, so not seeking to solicit support for any particular argument, rather I am just letting you know about the ongoing discussion as it provides some additional context as to why the category was removed. Thanks! Dfadden (talk) 10:34, 27 February 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi, if the category is deleted I think that a bot will then remove the redlink to the category from relevant articles. There's no need to do this ahead of the outcome of the deletion discussion. Regards, Nick-D (talk) 06:47, 28 February 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNote[edit]\nHey, I've noticed you and Gray eyes going at it with adding and removing categories. I'm sorry if I'm out of line, but I'd ask you both to talk about your reasoning with each other- it looks to be edit warring. (Acer's userpage |what did I do now) 00:37, 1 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nPlease see the CSD linked in the thread above. Gray eyes removed the categories out of process, and has been asked by two different editors to undo this. I'm now doing some of the reverts for them. This obviously isn't edit warring. Regards, Nick-D (talk) 00:39, 1 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nOh, I see. I apologize for jumping to conclusions. (Acer's userpage |what did I do now) 00:43, 1 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNo worries. Nick-D (talk) 00:52, 1 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nHello, Nick-D,\nI just noticed that the international airport categories had been refilled by you and another editor and wanted to thank you for helping revert this error. The relevant CFD still hasn't been closed and it was premature to have emptied the categories. Liz Read! Talk! 01:42, 19 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNot a problem, and thank you for this post. Nick-D (talk) 08:29, 19 March 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nYour edit / revision of history regarding FSK - Forsvarets Spesialkommando[edit]\nWhy are you insisting on this. Don't dissrespect Norwegian millitary personell like this. Plenty of sources has been added to the individual mission pages. Some might be hard to find in English or not active, but they are still historicaly correct. Sources are Norwegian and sometimes american / english, german news article and book references.\n\nSorry, I missed that the sources have since been added for most of that material. Throwing accusations around like me not respecting Norwegian soldiers is pretty silly though. This is an encyclopaedia, not an exercise in nationalism.

My mother served in the WAAF at Binbrook and others during WW2 and took many photos of life on the base, WAAFs, members of the RAF Regiment and of course many of the bomber crews. Among those of course was Mack Donald Seale, a very experienced and highly decorated veteran, with his crew. J R Spigot (talk) 06:37, 24 April 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi, It's a photo of five men sitting in front of a shed, in an article that already has too many photos and on a topic which the AWM has extensive high quality coverage of in its image database. The article does not refer to this pilot, and there's a much superior photo of him in a bomber in the article as well. I'd suggest that you also correct the record for this image at Commons to specify that your mother took the photo rather than you. Regards, Nick-D (talk) 08:28, 24 April 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nFA military history[edit]\nHello! I want to get my first FA-class article, and as I can see it's strongly advised for me to get an FA mentor. I looked at the list, and you seem to specialise in military history, which is what my article relates to. I've ensured that the article follows the manual of style, that the references support what is said, the images are all public domain, etc etc, basically just checking against the criteria. The page is Third Anglo\u2013Asante War, and I do have prior experience as I have made many pages (along with one related to the same series of wars which is a GA article). I hope you don't mind this, and any help would be very appreciated. Thank you! Setergh (talk) 12:03, 3 May 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHello, I'll look over that article later today.

ADG are equipped with Anti Tank Weapons, Direct Fire Weapons, Markman and Sniper Rifles. and other weapons and equipment \nThe only change to Roles, possibly is the Bomb Disposal role as I believe this role may not be Shared with 65 Airfield Recovery Squadron which has a EOD Element.\nFor your consideration\nKindness Regards  \nE 106.70.86.179 (talk) 04:04, 28 June 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nSure, but this doesn't all need to be listed in the infobox as they are roles that are common to air force infantry.

Regards, Nick-D (talk) 05:21, 28 June 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nHi Nick-D\nJust to clarify, I did not originally list any thing in the Infobox, I just changed the order to make it read,(I believe) a bit better, I checked RAAF Brochures and Information and compared with other World Air Forces as I found some of the information concerning but it turned out to correct and also point of difference between similar organisations  I did not feel it would be fair to delete the Original Authors work which I basically peer reviewed\nKindest Regards 106.70.86.179 (talk) 06:29, 28 June 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nNick-D\nI think you do not understand the RAAF Air Defence Guards Role and tasking beyond your misbelief that they are some sought of Security Guards,  The Word \"Guard\" is a bit misunderstood in the context the full scope of the capacity of  RAAF Air Defence Guards,\nIf you take time to do further reading on the current RAAF Security Forces you will have a better understanding that the ADG is a mustering,  the Roles and tasks that all within  either Security Force Squadron or additional for NCOs in a Training capacity from Base Training to Combat Survival Training\nRegards Exsap (talk) 06:02, 28 June 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI actually am familiar with the role of ADGs. We just don't provide this level of detail in infoboxes given their role is to briefly summarise information for readers. Please see MOS:INFOBOXPURPOSE, which notes \"The less information that an infobox contains, the more effectively it serves its purpose, allowing readers to identify key facts at a glance. Some infoboxes need to use more than a handful of fields, but information should be presented in a short format wherever possible, and should exclude unnecessary content\". The content you are referring to is at Airfield Defence Guards#Duties and mission roles, which would benefit from references - can you please add references to that section of the article? Please also do not post from both IP and logged in accounts.

This was partly achieved through reorganising some content and partly by adding content. Can you please have a read and let me know if this was the sort of thing you were thinking and if you have any suggestions for improvement.\nThanks in advance. TarnishedPathtalk 12:24, 21 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\n@TarnishedPath: Sorry for my slow response here. That section looks excellent. Nick-D (talk) 10:15, 24 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI've currently got it listed to be copy edited at WP:GOCER, but it looks like that might take a while. Do you think it's up to good enough standard to go straight to nominating as a WP:FAC? TarnishedPathtalk 10:33, 24 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nI think that this would benefit from a copy edit. I'm far from an expert on grammar, but I'll have a crack over the weekend. Nick-D (talk) 07:44, 25 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nMuch appreciated.

There is heaps of reference's to draw on to confirm what is current and correct.\nThank you for your time 106.70.86.179 (talk) 05:07, 22 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nPlease add references then - see WP:V. I've just removed a range of other very detailed material that lacks references. The article has been tagged as needing references since September 2015, so there has been plenty of time to add them. It would be great if you can do this. There is advice on how to add references at Help:Referencing for beginners that might be helpful here. Please stop re-adding material that has been removed for being unreferenced without first providing a reference to a reliable source. Please let me know if you have any questions about this, and I'll do my best to assist.

I'm planning on nominating James Cook for FA later this year. But before that, I'm looking for a black-belt in military history to do a peer review.  Would  you be available to do a peer review in early August?  No worries if you're too busy. Cheers. Noleander (talk) 12:56, 23 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nHi, I'll be away in the first week of August, but would be happy to read over the article when I get home. Can you please leave a message when the article is ready? Regards Nick-D (talk) 10:36, 24 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nExcellent!    I'll notify you (sometime after 7 August) whenever the article is ready for PR.  Thanks! Noleander (talk) 15:17, 24 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n@Nick-D:  If you are still interested, I created a Peer Review request for James Cook, at WP:Peer review/James Cook/archive4. The article is a Vital Article level 3, so  your unique and thoughtful insights (and your special background in military history) would be greatly appreciated. (Another editor jumped in and contributed some suggestions already, but you can ignore that: multiple reviewers are a good thing).  Thanks!! Noleander (talk) 16:31, 9 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nThanks for the note - I'll read this over.

The new websites don't have an archive to search back many years. I think previously it was nearly 15 years of editions. Editions available online now start at 2025. The Trove Army (National\u00a0: 1980 - 2023) newspaper archive for example is only up to 2023. So, many editions between 2023 and 2025 are now not available online. Melbguy05 (talk) 09:14, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\n\nThanks for the note. Defence is amazingly awful at things like this. They are also forever breaking links. Many stories published in the service newspapers are now also published in the news section of defence.gov.au, which seems more stable so that might be an option here. Regards, Nick-D (talk) 10:08, 31 July 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nDYK for Ann Davis (convict)[edit]\n\n\n\nOn 9 August 2025, Did you know was updated with a fact from the article Ann Davis (convict), which you recently created, substantially expanded, or brought to good article status. The fact was ... that the jury of matrons who assessed whether Ann Davis was pregnant after she was sentenced to death were the first civilian jurors for a criminal trial in New South Wales? The nomination discussion and review may be seen at Template:Did you know nominations/Ann Davis (convict). You are welcome to check how many pageviews the nominated article or articles got while on the front page (here's how, Ann Davis (convict)), and the hook may be added to the statistics page after its run on the Main Page has completed. Finally, if you know of an interesting fact from another recently created article, then please feel free to suggest it on the Did you know talk page.\n\n\n ~~ AirshipJungleman29 (talk) 00:03, 9 August 2025 (UTC)[reply]\nThe Bugle: Issue 232, August 2025[edit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour Military History Newsletter\n\nProject news: From the editors; awards and honours; contest results\nArticles: Last month's new featured and A-class content\nBook review: Hawkeye7 looks at four works spanning ancient to modern times\nTimeline: This month in military history\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bugle is published by the Military history WikiProject.
