Any editor can submit, review, or otherwise help manage requests. There are currently 27 requests on this page and 340 archived requests.\nBefore placing a request, be advised of the following:\n\nOnly add requests for notable topics. Subjects require significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject for articles to be created. Requests must include external links to multiple reliable sources that prove its notability. See WP:VG/RS for more information about reliable sources for video games.\nDo not place requests with insufficient sources in hopes for more sources to be found later. If a topic does not have enough right now, it should not be added. Do not use this page as a source aggregator.\nDo not place requests for remasters, compilations, or expansions. Though there are exceptions, these topics are usually better discussed in articles about the original games. Add sources to those articles' talk pages instead.\nMost requests are never fulfilled. If you look at old revisions of this page, you will notice that many requests still have red links. (2017, 2014) There are also hundreds of requests that have been archived due to no action being taken on them. Requests can sit for several years before being assessed, and any editor may remove a request from the list if they deem it not notable. If you really want to see an article made, it is a better idea to make it yourself.\nOld requests are archived. In an effort to keep the list manageable, games that do not have substantial coverage beyond reviews and release information will be moved to an archive if the request is not acted upon within a year. The intent is to limit the list to new requests, and topics that are highly notable and should be prioritized. Requests in the archive can still be reviewed for creation as any other request. Before placing a request, ensure it is not in the archive list. If new substantial material is published for a topic in the archive, it can be moved back to this page.\n\nInstructions[edit]\nTo add a new entry:\nRead the \"Before placing a request...\" section at the top of this page.\nFollow the technical instructions at the bottom of the list (hidden in article source, you will need to be in edit mode to see)\nOptional: Sign your request (with 3 tildes), as it will help you get notified as to your request's fate\nTo review a request:\nReview the links provided to determine if GNG has been met.\nIf GNG is met, take the sources and create an article at the appropriate article name. If it is not met, determine if there is possibly a better location, or target article to discuss the subject, and merge into there. It is possible there may be no place to merge and the request should just be canceled.\nIf you know who placed the request, send them a message letting them know what you did with the request\nRemove the entry from the list.\nMove old requests to archives:\nRequests should be moved to Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Requests/Archive if both these conditions are met:\nHas been listed here for at least 1 year\nThe sources provided do not demonstrate sustained, significant coverage. (Typically meaning the sources only consist of release information, reviews, and previews. They lack development information, staff interviews, retrospective coverage, or other analysis.)\nRequests on the archive page can still be assessed and created like any request on the main page.\n\nList[edit]\nFor archived requests, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Requests/Archive\n\n\n\nDate Requested\n\nArticle(s) requested\n\nRelease year\n\nOriginal platform[a]\n\nSources\n\n\nMarch 2018\n\n Talking Walls, Edutainment game about important walls in history\n\n2000\n\nPC\n\n[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n\nMarch 2018\n\nLa Prisi\u00f3n\u00a0[es] (the MMORPG that led to Dinamic Software's  bankruptcy)\n\n2000\n\nPC\n\n[7][8][9][10][11]A bunch of news sources\n\n\nJune 2019\n\nDungeon Hearts\n\n2013\n\nMobile\n\n[12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21]\n\n\nOctober 2019\n\n V2000 - Embarrassing that a David  Braben game does not have an article.
