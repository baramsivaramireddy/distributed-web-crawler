It was simply to attract more eyes to articles in need of attention.  The intent is not simply to work on Good Articles, but also to work on articles that have had Good status revoked, or that are in need.  The articles can be musician pages, band pages, discography lists, or perhaps category based tasks.\nPlease state the type of attention that you believe your nominee requires, and what the aim is.\n\nCurrent article[edit]\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\n\nNone currently\n\nHow to nominate[edit]\nAny person can nominate any article that's in the scope of female musicians attention from the Women in music project.  Whether the article is currently a Good Article or in an advanced state of disrepair shouldn't matter, as the end result of seven days of work on the article will advance the cause as a whole.\nEnter the name of the page, and date it (five tildes). Add yourself as a supporter of the article being nominated if you wish, and date it (four tildes). Please add new nominations at the top of the listing.\n\nTemplates[edit]\nNomination template[edit]\n===[[article name]]===\nNominated ''{{subst:CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{subst:CURRENTDAY}}, {{subst:CURRENTYEAR}}''.\n\nSupport\n#~~~~\n\nComments\n#\n\nUsage templates[edit]\n\n\nWhat to type\nWhat it makes\nWhat it's for\n\n\n{{WomeninMusicCOTM}}Talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current Women in Music Collaboration of the month is \"[[]]\".
