This was the article title for a couple years, from creation until just last month. -- Tavix (talk) 22:31, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nKeep, it is common practice to keep former titles as redirects. Especially long-term former titles. Randy Kryn (talk) 23:16, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nKeep: The only mention of said address on wikipedia is in reference to the Carter family. TartarTorte 23:21, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nKeep per all above. Thryduulf (talk) 23:49, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nKeep per above. The address name may be very common, but it is quite clearly well-associated with this property; the first results for \"209 Woodland Drive\" in Google are all sources that mention this house. Regardless, there are no mentions of a 209 Woodland Drive on Wikipedia that do not refer to this home. It also seems like a much more likely search term and wikilinking shorthand than typing out \"Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter House\". \u30c4\u00a0LunaEatsTuna (\ud83d\udcac)\u2014 03:18, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nWithdraw proposed deletion; clearly this is a useful redirect that ought not be deleted.

This redirect was the result of Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Bynner Street station, and all of those redirects should be discussed together. It was an odd situation where the stop names only ever appeared on a single map showing a planned restoration of service (which never happened), and it's unclear whether the same stops were used when the service previously ran. It's tricky because the map is still floating around, making these plausible search terms, but they're unlikely to appear in the article. I'm ambivalent whether the redirects are kept or deleted, but it should be consistent for all of them. If the decision is delete, note also that most of the redirects have several variants that can be found at Special:WhatLinksHere/Green Line E branch.

It's pretty standard these days to self-censor on many websites because of aggressive algorithmic censorship, and just plain old harassment; c.f. seggs, unalive ([1]), and so on. Just substituting letters with similar characters in your swear words doesn't cut it any more, and some very popular websites are known for banning and/or removing accounts for single infractions. Wikipedia doesn't of course, it's patently absurd, but I understand why someone would not want to take the chance. Replacing \"shit\" with \"poop\" , or doing so intentionally because of the aforementioned censorship, is absolutely a plausible \"error\", and while the move shouldn't have been done without discussion it was a long way from vandalism. See also Urban Dictionary and Reddit. Ivanvector (Talk/Edits) 17:44, 8 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nI disagree.

If someone is navigating the categories from the articles, there are no links to the 2020 category anyway, and once they do get to the categories, they'll find strange links to 2020 on 2018 and 2021 that do not, and will not ever, correspond to any articles contained in that year:\n\n\n20132014201520162017201820212022202320242025\n\n\n\n\n\n20152016201720182020202120222023202420252026\n\n~\u00a0Tom.Reding (talk \u22c5dgaf)\u00a0 15:22, 6 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nMy apologies, I saw your response a bit ago and started doing research but forgot to reply. It would be rather nice if there was a way to indicate somehow that Category:2020 World Para Athletics European Championships could be excluded from the {{csn}}, but from my recollection of my research last week, I could not find a way for that to be possible. With that, I reluctantly support deletion as messing up the nav is worse than the benefits that could come from the few people who are trying to type in \"Category:2020 World Para Athletics European Championships\" into the search bar to try to find Category:2021 World Para Athletics European Championships. I'll strike my vote above and change to delete.

No further edits should be made to this section.\nThe result of the discussion was draftify old content. This is a slightly unusual close, but I think it follows logically from what's been said below. There is unanimous consensus that this redirect is not suitable. At the same time, Thryduulf objects to deletion of the old content, and a single person's objection is enough to get a page restored when it was deleted non-controversially. Rather than delete here and have this draftified at REFUND, I'm cutting out the middle man. From Draft:List of Commonly Used Queer Acronyms, Thryduulf and any other users will have the opportunity to improve the content and find a more appropriate title. Or if someone wants to move it straight back to mainspace, they can do that too; this should be treated like a contested PROD in that case, with AfD as the next step.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|she) 05:22, 22 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nList of Commonly Used Queer Acronyms \u2192 LGBT \u00a0(talk\u00a0\u00b7 links\u00a0\u00b7 history\u00a0\u00b7 stats)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0[\u00a0Closure:\u00a0keep/retarget/delete\u00a0]\u00a0\nWhile there are queer acronyms discussed at the target page, to my understanding there is no quote unquote list as described by this redirect's title.\nThis was originally a standalone article before being BLAR'd into this page, although I don't know whether this redirect is useful to begin with, as I don't think this is an exact title that would be sought for on Wikipedia, and pointing at the general LGBT article with no modification I feel would be less than helpful if the search term was this specific. Utopes (talk / cont) 07:27, 5 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\n\nRevert as a contested BLAR. Questions about whether the content is useful and if so what the title should be are not matters for RfD. Thryduulf (talk) 13:34, 5 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDelete. I've looked at the content that was blanked to make the redirect and it's no good at all. Even if we wanted a List of Commonly Used Queer Acronyms this would not be where we would start. I think I can see the logic behind the redirect, i.e. to match the redirect on LGBT (acronym), but it would probably have been better deleted than redirected. If anybody thinks that it is worth saving then a revert and an AfD would be the way to go but I don't see that ending in anything other than deletion so let's just cut that corner and get rid of it. --DanielRigal (talk) 20:18, 5 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nThe point is that cutting corners is contrary to policy which states that articles to be deleted (which don't meet a speedy deletion criterion) are discussed at AfD. RfD is not AfD and should not be used to delete article content. Whether you would personally start with this content is irrelevant.

Thanks, CycloneYoris talk! 06:00, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDelete, agreeing with DanielRigal. WP:BLAR stipulates that AfD should be used if editors cannot agree on the blank-and-redirect itself. There is no such disagreement in this instance\u2014there has been no one that has made an argument for keeping the article content\u2014thus no contested BLAR. -- Tavix (talk) 19:29, 13 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nNobody has been given the opportunity to comment on the article content, but since you insist on making things explicit: I support keeping the article content, at least until it has been discussed at AfD. Thryduulf (talk) 00:03, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nEditors have been given over a week so far to comment on the edit history and decide it's keepworthiness. For example, DanielRigal and myself have done just that. (Also, anyone could have challenged the BLAR since it was actioned several months ago.) You have not made an argument for keeping the article content, your argument is simply to send it to AfD\u2014that's not the same thing. -- Tavix (talk) 00:30, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nEditors have been invited to discus the redirect, they have not been made aware there is content to evaluate unless they come to this discussion about the redirect. Anyone could have challenged the BLAR... if they knew about it, which they most likely did not. Just because you disagree with my reasons for keeping the article content does not mean I have not made an argument for keeping it. The deletion policy does not permit us to delete article content at RfD, and we should not be doing so. Thryduulf (talk) 10:27, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nFrom the very beginning of this discussion, editors have been aware of the edit history and they can make their own recommendations about what they feel should happen to it. Because this is a redirect, should there be consensus to delete it at 'redirects for discussion', it can and should be deleted here. There's no need to bring AfD into this unless there is actually disagreement on the article content. And no, you have not made an argument for why this content should be kept. -- Tavix (talk) 12:55, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nOnly those who have chosen to look at this discussion about a redirect are aware that content is being discussed - nowhere is that advertised. Also, there is disagreement on the article content: I believe it should be restored for evaluation in accordance with policy, you don't. What I don't understand is how you can state that I haven't made an argument that the content should be kept when I've explicitly said it should be kept multiple times and explained why on each occasion. Thryduulf (talk) 14:30, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nIf you feel the discussion should be advertised elsewhere, you are free to do so. I will point out that the discussion is already being advertised in much the same way as it would if it was at AfD, such as Wikipedia:WikiProject Gender studies#Article alerts. The article content already is being evaluated in accordance with policy, given the fact that it is under a redirect and is being discussed at the proper deletion forum for redirects. Please provide a rationale for keeping this list at AfD. You have not done this\u2014your argument is simply for reverting in the interest of an AfD !vote. I do not support 'revert and send to AfD' !votes unless there is actually an argument to keep the article content itself. -- Tavix (talk) 14:52, 14 December 2023 (UTC)[reply]\nDelete as misleading redirect - there is no such list at the target. Also, I see the creation of this list as WP:POINTY, as the creator's earlier Commonly used queer acronyms three months prior, with the same content as this, was similarly BLARd. Editors desirous of restoring the content may want to bring that to AfD instead, and if the outcome is to keep, move it to a proper title such as List of LGBT acronyms.
